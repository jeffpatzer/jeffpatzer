During the fall of 2010 I spent three months as a volunteer intern in rural Perú. My main goal was to educate teachers and students about how to better use their XO laptops. I ended up learning as much from them as I think they did from me.
While in Perú I developed a series of workshops to be used while teaching the kids.

You can catch up on all the blog posts that I wrote while there.

If you want a quick way to get an idea of what my experience was like, check out my final report. It is a six part series.

Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 | Part 4 | Part 5 | Part 6

Some of my favorite posts:

	Okay, Just teach! – One of my first schools visited and how they eased me into the process.
	Callanca, not to be confused with Llanca – A place with one of the brightest students I met, and how I fear for her future.
	No Electricity? No Problem! – How I dealt with not having electricity at this school.
	Walking and Rain: A day in the life of an OLPC Intern – A detailed description of one of my days. Involves lots of hiking.
	Are laptops the most important thing?** - Questioning the OLPC program and whether it is the help the kids need.

Hope and Josh, the other two interns, that were in Perú with me also kept a very well written blog.
