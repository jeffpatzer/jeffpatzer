		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Starting last fall, I attended an information session about One Laptop per Child and the internships they offer that span the globe. OLPC is the original creating of the netbook, dubbed the 100$ laptop by the media. Although the laptop does not cost this, rather around 190$, they did spark a revolution in cheap, mobile computing. They redesigned the laptop to work to teach children, to give them the tools to learn and make their situation better. As an EECS engineering student, this sounded like a great opportunity to spend time in another country doing some ecotourism. I applied as soon as the application was ready and was accepted soon after. Its now only a week away from my departure :)

My intern duties are described as "technical". This means that I will be traveling to different schools fixing laptops, setting laptops up, and aiding in the integration of the laptops with the everyday workings of the school. I will arrive in Lima and spend a week training. Then I will travel to the Ancash region with my two other fellow interns. We will be based in Huaraz and travel to different schools in the region. Most language spoken will be in Spanish :P

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As of now there is less than 24 hours until I am on a plane on my way to Peru. If you are wondering, am I excited?, duh! Anyways this post won't be long just giving a quick <strong>run-down of  my setup</strong> and the things that I am taking.

When considering that I am going to be gone for about four months, I had to really consider the best way to keep things light. I decided that I wanted to be able to carry everything with me at one time, so that moving around would be manageable. To this end I decided on the following set-up:
<ul>
	<li><strong>One large backpack - 70L Osprey Aether</strong>: This is the main bag that holds the majority of things like my clothes, sleeping bag, camping equipment, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>One small backpack - ~20L Camelback with 3L bladder</strong>: This will be an everyday backpack I can take with me when sightseeing or doing day trips.</li>
	<li><strong>One messenger bag - Performance bike messenger bag</strong>: This is my main bag for carrying things like my computers and camera.</li>
</ul>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-24" href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2010/09/02/one-day-left/imag0032/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-24 " title="IMAG0032" src="http://jeffpatzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMAG0032-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>

The <strong>smartest thing that I did</strong> was to use lot of smaller bags and stuff sacks within the other bags. This helps to compartmentalize things and keep things organized. I've put all computer things in a bag, socks in a bag, camping and cook equipment in a bag. The idea is that I want to be able to get to things quickly and keep them from getting disorganized.

<strong>Snacks</strong>: Teddy Grahams, 2 packs wasabi mix from Berkeley Bowl (yum)

This is Sheba and Yoda (2 of Â 3 of my parent's dogs), it's purely for <strong>cuteness factor</strong>:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning I got up (Sep 3) at 3am for the drive to LAX for my 920am flight. I think this is the first time I can say that my parents dogs were woken up by me instead of the other way around. My flight was two legs, the first one from LAX to Houston and the second from Houston to Lima. The best part about this was that my connections were at the same gate so I didn't have to go anywhere. Each flight was packed, but it didn't hinder the flight experience. I worked on the XO laptop most of the time, playing with the programs and building a game with one of them (the brick smashing one).  The flights went really quick it seemed and I have to commend the folks at Continental for being awesome. They were really professional and everything went down without a hitch. I gladly recommend them to anybody else.

Once I arrived in Lima it was the customary long wait in customs for the guy to spend 20 seconds just giving me stamps. Seriously, no questions, nothing, just STAMP, STAMP, buenos noches! I think I wowed him with my "Hola" upon approaching the counter that he knew I could be trusted. After this got in the cab the hostel sent, whereupon the driver began to speak extremely quick spanish, then wait patiently while I bumbled through a response. I had as much a hard time speaking spanish because I was holding on for dear life as the driver weaved his way in and out of traffic like a go-cart driver. I don't know how we didn't crash as we were careening down the street at mach-10, blinkers flashing, horn honking, and talking at the same time. Skillz!

		<title>Day 1 - Lima: Exploring Miraflores</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow, so first day in Lima. I spent most the day in Miraflores exploring the area. I woke up around 9am due to not having gone to sleep until around 2am. I slowly roused myself to shave, take a shower, and eat some complimentary breakfast rolls. At which point, I promptly packed my backpack with a guide book, a spanglish dictionary, some snacks, cameras and off I went (approximately 1030-11am). 

Left the Hostel and made my way down to the beach area. Really I was up on the cliffs overlooking the beach, but close enough. I walked along the cliff edge through a nice park, into another park called Lover's Park (see picture of massive statues making out) and on down into the trendy shopping center called Larco Mar. It's an awesome shopping mall built into the cliff side overlooking the ocean. There were a lot of people walking dogs and riding bikes along the cliff edge through the park. My favorite was the extremely decked out mountain bikers riding at about 5mph, I mean, what's the point if you aren't going fast and down a mountain? At this point I turned and walked up Larco Ave into the main Miraflores area. I found a supermarket to get some lunch, which consisted of about a liter of drinkable fruit yogurt (YUM) and a couple empenadas (meat filled pastry, again YUM). I ate and continued my way up into the downtown parks. 

At this point I decided to go and visit Huaca Pucllana, a massive mud brick pyramid in the middle of the city. Pretty interesting, there was a Peruvian hairless dog there. One of the ugliest creatures I've yet to see, but also interesting. His skin felt like oily cloth, very friendly too. On the tour I met a young Canadian lady (I really want to use the word chick, but I'm being PC, so YCL it is), who was also traveling alone for the day. We decided to pool our funds and take a taxi to a really nice museum. Spent a couple hours at the museum looking at old Peruvian artifacts, including the erotic room, and returned back to Miraflores to a sports bar to watch the Peru-Canada soccer game. Consequently this was also the best place to be to watch college football as well because it was packed with Americans. We ended up not watching most of the soccer game, but talking to a really helpful and friendly guy who gave us great tips on places to stay, where to go, and how to get there (Thanks!). So I watched some college football highlights (haha Ole Miss) and drank a Peruvian beer (YUM). After the game ended, Canada surrendered 0-2, uh I mean, lost, me and YCL walked to her tour bus where she left to take a night tour of downtown Lima. I noticed a large grouping of people across in the park and went to investigate. Consequently, it was a large group of strangers dancing, awesome! So I sat watching the people dance (you can too, see the video) and was talked to by two random guys for about an hour then a different guy after that. The second guy was super friendly, a network engineer for a phone company in Peru, and we went on getting some food and talking for another hour or so. I tried Inca Kola, Amos would love it because it tastes like Cotton Candy and bubble gum, don't think I'll get it again :/. After this, my brain having turned to mush from trying to not sound like a 1st grader speaking spanish all day, I returned to my hostel to promptly collapse.

		<title>Day 2 - Lima Centro</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well today was interesting. I met my other two interns Josh and Hope, who I'll be spending the next couple months with. They arrived in the morning after a long red-eye flight and promptly went to sleep. Around noon Josh and myself, Hope deciding to sleep, took a cab into Lima Centro and went to see the sights downtown. We saw a couple plazas that had some parades/processions going on there. Then we visited the Inquisition Museum (museum de inquiscion) and the San Francisco church. Both were interesting, but the most interesting thing had to be the crypts in the church. They were full of bones of people who had been buried there. After the church, Josh and I made our way up into Chinatown and through the market. It was a good opportunity to talk with and get to know Josh. After this we caught a Taxi back to our Hostel and headed out to find dinner. We had Arabic food, which wasn't too bad. Food here is quite cheap. You can get a meal for about 10 soles or about 3.50$. 

For dinner we had a surfer guy join us from the hostel who has spent the better part of his adult life working as a tree planter in canada during the summer (he's from canada, eh?) and then surfing in south america during the winter. He has lots of interesting stories, of course. After dinner we returned to the hostel for some darts, foosball (which I dominated in, YEAH!), and a game of bananagrams (like scrabble). I won both of those games too (YEAH!). Then we went to have a late night snack and are now exhausted!

Not quite as much espanol as yesterday, but still quite a bit!

I'll probably move things about as well to help trim it up a bit. Still working out the kinks :)

I was thinking about that, while the date is appended to the bottom of the post, it might make more sense to have the date in the title. I'll probably use the date in addition to the Day business.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was pretty easy going. We woke up kind of late and spent the early part of the morning going over our XO's and material that we will need to know for tomorrow's training at the ministry. We went for a late lunch at a Backpacker kitchen for a fixed meal (price of 10$). I got the ceviche for the appetizer and "cau cau" for the main dish. For those of you who don't know, like I didn't, "cau cau" is actually cows stomach. It wasn't too bad, but I don't think that I'll be getting it again :). We had a pear syrupy compote for desert, it wasn't too bad. The best part of the meal was actually when I accidentally ate a tomato looking pepper, who soon induced a 5 minute coughing fit and tear session as my sinuses experienced a serious butt whopping. 

After this I spent a majority of the day fixing my website, the theme got corrupted so I switched to a new one, you like? Josh and Hope (hereon to be described as Hosh), went to Huaca Pullcana which I had already visited. After their return we got dinner and relaxed. We are calling it an early night because tomorrow we have to go to the ministry for training, starting at 830 (meaning an early rise time for the 40 minute cab ride). We're excited to begin the work and are anxious to see what will happen tomorrow. 

Sorry, but I don't have any cool pictures today :( but should have some more soon!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was an early riser for us. We were up at 640ish to get ready for our big training day at the ministry, I even shaved. We got ready and hopped in a cab to make our way to the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library). We were able to experience the Lima morning traffic rush, which wasn't that bad actually. Upon arriving at the Ministry, we promptly went to the front of the line to ask for "Carlos", our babysitter for the day. Those in the line promptly gave us death stares and cursed us under their breath for not standing in line. Although their victory was soon had as we were told Carlos wasn't there, so we'd have to wait (smiles from the line). So we waited for Carlos to show up, which he did, then we got to really cut the line, HA! Carlos is a nice, opera loving (and blogging) gentleman, that was the only person to speak with us in English the entire day. He showed us in, bought us coffee, and did a quick introduction. Here began the interesting part...

We were introduced to Marie Antoinette, who of course only speaks rapid spanish in a vocabulary I've yet to even think of mastering, and Carlos asks us to all introduce ourselves, talk about our school, where were from, what we studied, and WHY WE WANTED TO DO THIS PROGRAM. Of course, IN SPANISH, for the benefit of Marie. Hope went first, sounded great with her spanish, and wowed them. Next I was to speak. I bumbled through a explanation, with Marie finishing and correcting words. Then, because Carlos had to step out of the room for a phone call, he returns, and asks us to repeat. So I stumble around like a 1st grader, againnnn, Marie corrects almost everything, againnnn, and Carlos nods and smiles at my imbecile attempt to sound knowledgeable about myself. Josh follows behind and does pretty good, although still incurs the correcting wrath of Marie!

For the rest of the day, we spend time learning how to motivate the teachers to use laptops. Negotiate with them! Apparently the kids learn great on them and master the technology quickly, but the teachers are difficult to convince. We were taught how to repair the software of the laptop, the most issues simply require flashing the laptop. We had a spectacularly large lunch of chicken and french fries, with an Inca Kola (bubble gum soda) to wash it down. I promise myself at Lunch to go for a run later. Once we finished we returned back to the hostel, to make bus reservations for our trip to Huaraz (on Thursday morning) and try to find a place to stay (almost got that). Then I went for my run, and felt like I wanted to toss my cookies the whole time. Afterwards, we got some food, I didn't puke, of the Chifa (chinese) variety that tasted just like Panda Express. After my chinese experiences in San Francisco, I probably won't go back :P

Esta todo para ahora, Buenas Noches!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For our last day in Lima, Hosh (Josh and Hope) and myself decided to venture back to Lima centro for a nice afternoon of exploring. We decided to try our luck with the bus system so that we could save some money (only 33 cents to ride) and also to experience how the locals travel. Needless to say the buses drive about as crazy as the taxi drivers, just with more mass. The other interesting part about their bus systems is street vendors can come on the bus to try and sell some snacks. 

Once we go to our destination, we found they were having a food festival. However, they were charging a ticket fee (which you had to stand in line for a long time) or of course you could scalp some tickets for a slightly greater fee. A Limeno (person from Lima) from Queens New York talked to us for a bit and tried to help us get tickets so that we didnât get taken advantage of. He said that Hopeâs Spanish (which is essentially fluent) wasnât very good, which really pissed her off to Josh and mine amusement. However, once we learned that they were also charging for food inside, we abandoned this attempt. (First Friend of the Day)

After our failed attempt at the food festival, we started walking and ended up in a mall. It was fairly similar to malls in the states. We ate at the food court where Josh and I tried the local fast food chain Bembos. I got a hamburger with some sort of egg hash on it, the burger tasted more like sausage though. It wasnât too bad, but I think I will try something else next time :-P. After our snack we made our way through Lima Centro, where we met another Limeno (Second Friend of the Day) who wanted to take us to his local bar. We were in the process of sharing a beer, when we were assaulted by an extremely drunk man. (Third Friend of the Day) He tried to sell us some things, we declined, so of course then he asked for a bit of beer. At this point, I would have told him to get lost, but our host gave him a bit, so the guy sat down and proceeded to talk with us (read, spit). He sat down between me and our Limeno friend, while Hosh were on the other side of the table. Let me say that this guy was extremely drunk and dirty, I was extremely uncomfortable! Hosh seemed to find my discomfort funny, needless to say I was not laughing. He continued to linger for too long of a time, talking to us about the random thoughts he has. Eventually we got the bar owner to get rid of the guy. We finished up our beers and began to say our goodbyes to our Limeno friend. At this point (and I feared this might happen), he mentions he has three kids, only works a couple of days, etc, and wonders if we could give him some money to buy them dinner. We offer to buy them some food, but of course that wonât do. So we give him nothing and say goodbye. 

At this point we begin to make our way towards Parque de la Reserva (park) to see a light show. We met up with a couple friends of Hopeâs (Fourth and Fifth friends of the Day), both doing Fulbright scholarships in Peru. We got a quick bite to eat, I had a nice pie and a hot chocolate, then we returned to the park and watched the light show. It was quite impressive (see the attached videos). Afterwards, we said goodbyes and got on a small bus back to our Hostel. Let me say that there are a couple types of buses in Lima, and Peru in general, those that are public and those that are private ones. The private ones, combis, are like big vans. They speed from corner to corner, with a guy hanging out of the door yelling sing-song the destination. They push you into the van and speed along. Our door dude (for lack of a better term), knew people along the way. He jumped out and grabbed a friendâs cigarette, puffed it and got back in, Josh and I were floored. We made it back to our Hostel in one piece with a few good stories from our day. We packed up our things to prepare our things for the trip to Huaraz the next morning. What a day of new friends!

More pics will be added.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I got my first taste of south american land transport. Quite an experience, although not for the reasons you might think. We woke up early to take a taxi to the bus station. We got to the bus station around 9 (for our 930 departure), got our tickets and then went to wait at the departing terminal (I say this because the station was like a mini-airplane terminal). At which point the gate we were standing at was taken over by a TV commercial crew. Would this cause our gate to be moved? Of course, but not for another 20 minutes :/. Anyways, we got on the bus no problem and headed on our way (25 minutes late). 

We got second level seats in the front of the bus. This was great for two reasons: the view and its as far as possible from the terrible smelling bathroom. However, as we came to find out the bathroom smell would pale in comparison to the other passengers riding with us. We were traveling almost exclusively with a large group of Israelis. Now, don't misunderstand me, I am Jewish and harbor no ill feelings towards Jewish people, but these people were just plain rude! It was quite embarrassing. They had one person in their whole group that could speak English (for about 20 of them). The others consistently insisted (I use this term lightly because it was really more like yelling) that the stewardess (bus stewardess?) speak English too them. The poor stewardess. They were also quite pushy and disrespectful of others boundaries. The guy sleeping with me felt it was ok to just slouch over into my seat for a lot of the ride (see pic), until I started talking to him. Then we became more friendly and he knocked it off. He was traveling with a couple friends around south america for about 6 months (had only just arrived). Although when I asked if he spoke english, he responded with a huffy "Of course!". He also tried to instruct me on how to eat my mango, which I already knew how. Just a little pretentious :P

Beyond that, the bus ride went smoothly, I did some reading, wrote a blog post, watched some movies, and nearly puked when we were going through the pass. I got some serious vertigo and for about 45 minutes was working on my prana breathing (yoga people, is that the right term?). Huaraz is at 10,000ft and needless to say, I have had a small headache since I got here. The area outside of Lima, was pretty much a desert wasteland, not even cactus grows there. The cliffs on the coast were amazingly breathtaking. Josh got some pictures, but I wasn't able to. After this the desert becomes more lush, but even in Huaraz it is a dry place. The last bit of the bus ride was super sketchy though, as the road was very dark with lots of potholes. Speeding through the dark, dodging potholes like a go-cart driver, in a double-decker bus is enough to give anyone a start! We arrived fine though, got our bags, got to the hotel, and ate some food. I tried Guinea Pig, or Cuy, a specialty in the area from a French restaurant (also got veggies, thank god). Cuy was quite delicious, I'll definitely try it in other places. After that we returned back to our hotel where we all promptly passed out!

		<title>Day 7 - Huaraz, a quaint mountain town</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was our first full day in Huaraz (pronounced waaraz), and it was really interesting.  Read more about the city here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaraz  This is a very nice high-altitude town full of lots of markets and sun! No really, it was about 80degrees today. The entirety of the town center can be walked around and the outskirts only take about 10 mins to reach by foot. We are staying in a nice hotel close to the Plaza de Armas (city center). We can walk to get cheap food all over. 

We had a meeting with the Specialist this morning. We reviewed our jobs and what we will be doing. Hosh will be spending two weeks at a time in a village, living with the teachers. I will be staying in Huaraz and each day traveling to the villages, until about Oct 4 when I too will begin to stay out in the villages. The reason we are staying in the villages is because they are too far away to bus to and from in one day. For this first week, I'll be getting up at 5am on Mon and Tues to leave with the teachers. Wed is a field day, where I can play soccer with the kids, or whatever else game they want. Thurs and Fri I'll be traveling to a school close to Huaraz. It's really exciting to know that work is starting. While I enjoy being a tourist, I need purpose! The hardest part of this whole thing is going to be working in spanish all day. Voy a saber el idioma muy bien despues de este trabajo!

After our meeting, we strolled around the town. I got a picture of this little girl carrying a puppy, soooo cuttteeee! Hope got a haircut for about 1.80$. Now that is cheap! We then strolled through the market, where they have vegetables, random other stuff, and DEAD ANIMALS! Lots of ducks, pigs, cow tongues, and GUINEA PIGS! I love developing country markets, they make me want to be a veg! After the market, we strolled back to our hotel. Hope stayed there while Josh and went to hunt down a better map of the areas that we would be going to. We discovered that since the area we were heading to is not a tourist area, there are no maps. To combat this lack of direction, we will each be accompanying the teacher to their school. Should be an adventure, because not only do we have to take long bus rides, but these are accompanied with long walks (30 mins +).

After this we relaxed at the hotel for a bit, then went to get dinner at a pizza place. It was okay, definitely not a Pizzaiolo, but it did the job. We then ventured into a pool hall, which was full of young teenage guys, beyond the lady at the front desk Hope was the only other girl. We took an hour to play one game because the holes for the balls were about half the size of standard ones (why? I don't know, but thats why it took an hour). Josh and I had to stare down a couple guys who were eyeing Hope in a not so flattering manner. They soon stopped as they recognized the physical superiority that Josh and I possess (right?). After the pool hall we went back to the hotel to wait for the clubs to open (think 11pm +). We then visited the Zion Bar (Reggae Vibe) and then went to a Karaoke bar, where Josh and I wooed them with "Let it Be" by the Beatles. The whole place was thoroughly entertained by our off-key rendition! After this, we called it a night and returned back to our hotel to pass out :)

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[One of the reason with developing countries showing all the "DEAD ANIMALS" are to show that they are fresh, slaughtered the same day.  In many ways, by looking at the chicken that was hanging there, those are real farm chickens that actually walk and jump around eating worms rather than formulated feeds full of hormones, a price that we have to pay for progress.  As a matter of fact, if you travel around the world and look around at most Americans (from the good old US ofA), they look somewhat deformed into square shape, go to the mid-west.  You can even see the differenace between  Canadians vs. Americans, it is real but sad!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would agree with you, and don't get me wrong I don't have a problem with the hanging animals, its just something new for me. I think the shape of the people might not be completely linked to the hormones in the meat though. For instance, I've found many of the native indigenous women to have a similar shape to those Americans from the mid-west. I think it might be linked to diet, but is probably more influenced by the way one lives their life. Unfortunately, I can only conjecture on these points.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After last night's late night Karaoke I thought that I'd be able to sleep in a bit, I was wrong! I woke up promptly at 7am to the sounds of a marching band. Apparently today is a election rally day, and they wanted to get started early! In addition to the march bands, cars with massive speakers strapped to the top, streaked down the streets blaring election slogans. There were even a couple rallies in the Plaza de Armas (town square). At one point I even saw some sodas being distributed by a truck, where's my coke Obama?

Besides the early wake up call, I took the opportunity to read a bit more about the area and mark up my map of things to go and scout out. I investigated a cafe called "California Cafe" where they have a large book exchange and an even larger library of books. They have a cool vibe with some coaches and tables, whichever your preference. But, the best part, is they have WIFI! I'll definitely be hanging out here often. I then trotted down the street to check out a market where I can buy basic food supplies. They have some good deals. After this, I started to wander back to my hotel, where I found a couple courtyards in the middle of some blocks. They are very quaint and surrounded by restaurants and tour guide agencies. I also found a artisan market, where I can go to get some Peruvian goods before I head back to the states :)

After all the exploring I headed back to the hotel and Hosh and me headed out to go and get some lunch. We tried to find a vegetarian restaurant from my guide book, but it appeared to have been bulldozed, that or we just couldn't find it :/ In case anybody going to Huaraz is wondering, the place is Fuente de Salud on 562 Jose de la Mar. After lunch, we strolled around the town some more, picking up various provisions for the upcoming week. I bought some local cheese for about 1$ (what! so cheap!). I haven't tried it yet, but I'll let you all know how it tastes :)

At this point in the day, we headed back to the hotel and Josh and I went over the technical details for the XO once again. Just to refresh our memory. We made copies of the image for the XO and got everything set up that we might need. After going through all of this, we hung out working on various things. Then grabbed a small bite for dinner and topped it off with some Coca beer, which was delicious!

One thing I've noticed about the climate here is that is it quite warm, even though the altitude is quite high. It cools off at night, but not too much. The air is also quite dry, my lips are slowly becoming chapped :( but I've got some chapstick to combat it.

Did some HDR photos out of my window of the sunset :)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was an early wake up call. Hosh headed off to the bus around 730am for their two weeks in the village. I switched rooms to a single one from the triple that we were sharing. I unpacked things a bit and organized them since I'm going to be in this room for about a month. I even got a desk! Thank goodness, because my back was starting to hurt from having to work on the bed so much. I tried out the cheese this morning, the closest thing in taste and texture that I can relate it to is mozzarella, although the flavor is a bit different.  

After I was finished organizing, I grabbed my pack and headed off to check out a lookout over the city. It was probably about a 4-5 mile round trip walk (I'm guessing). The road takes a winding path up into the hills above the city. Eventually you arrive at a turnout for cars, that allows one to take in the whole valley of Huaraz at once. It really is quite impressive when viewed up on the hill. While the city is a decent size, you can also see that it isn't that big. It's definitely walkable, which makes it convenient to live in (don't have to take a taxi). Although I could have turned around at this point, I continued up the hill until I reached the end of the road. What I found there was extremely surprising, it was a private suburb. The suburb looked like it could have been found in military housing (a new one) development. The houses were new, the streets clean, and of course, the gate was guarded by two armed guards. We chatted for about 10 minutes and then I began to make my way back to town. 

Once back in town, I was starving. I tried to go to a trekking/pizza pub to check the place out and to get some pizza. Unfortunately their kitchen was closed and since I didn't want to book a tour, I left in search of something else. I decided to return to the restaurant where I had gotten a 5 sole (1.80$) lunch a couple days before. I had made the right decision. The dish I got was a fajita-like dish with french fries (they are literally in everything), and it was so delicious. I think those guys will be seeing a lot of me over the next few weeks. I mean, I can't even cook food for myself that cheap, they also give you a soup and this apple juice that is very tasty. 

After lunch I headed back to the hotel to work on some various things and relax after my long walk. I didn't do much the rest of the night beyond getting ready for tomorrow. It was nice to just relax :)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was my first day of working with kids in the field in the village of San Juan de Maqui. What an experience! It really reminded me why I am here and what I am doing. I woke up at 430am (yeah, thats right mom and dad) in order to meet the teacher who I was going to be working with for the day. He met me at the hotel around 545am and we trotted over to where the car would be picking all of the teachers (and me today) up. The car we rode in was a small station wag looking sucker, and when I say we I mean 10 people. It was so packed, you wouldn't need a seat belt, you weren't going anywhere! There were three people in the front, 4 in the back seat, and then 3 in the truck area riding backwards. I was in the back, which was fine with me, but when the road is bumpy and rocky, it sure does take a toll on one's back. 

The car ride lasted about an hour following a road up out of the Huaraz valley into the mountains to the west. When we got to a certain point, the teacher and myself disembarked and started walking through the hills for another 30 minutes. The village we were heading to is literally a small grouping of houses in the hills. When we eventually arrived at the small village, we were heartily greeted by the parents and children alike. 

The teacher and me went into the school house, which was actually really nice. They have three rooms for the school, but since there aren't as many children anymore, only one gets used. They have a small garden and a dirt courtyard for recess. A couple bathrooms, and I use this term loosely because its really more like a hole in the ground, but it does the trick. 

The teacher showed me the one laptop that was broken, and I started to flash the system. At this point the kids started arriving and began to take great interest in what I was doing. I explained it to them, but I don't think they understood me. I took a picture of them and then showed them some of my other pictures. Because they were so interested in the camera, I let them play with my camera (the point and shoot), which they loved! One of the parents brought us breakfast, which consisted of these fried bread things and fresh milk. I swear it must have just come out of the udders, because it was super creamy and super sweet, and SUPER TASTY! It was just a little warm, which was perfect for fighting off the slight cold of the morning. Although, the entire I was drinking it, I was hoping I wasn't going to get some parasite and have my insides turn into a large knot. Luckily it hasn't happened yet, so I think I'm ok. 

After breakfast, the teacher began instructing the children in division and multiplication. He made great use of the calculator activity to elaborate on his points. There are only enough laptops for the 4th and 2nd graders, but I think thats okay with the 1st graders because they seemed to like the blocks more anyways. An interesting thing I noticed that the kids do is point with their middle fingers. At first I was shocked, but then realized it was just that they were pointing. At one point the kids were interested in how to say my name. Now Jeffrey is an easy enough name to say, but they don't have the Jeff word construction. Consequently, its sounds more like Heff, which for some reason they found hilarious.

After the morning lesson, I showed the 4th graders, this was while the teacher was working with the other grades, how to do multiplication by 9 using the trick that and multiple of nine under 11 adds to 9 (9*7 = 63, 6+3=9). They seemed to think it was magic, then quickly forgot it at the sound of recess. I played soccer with the boys, they seemed to like that. Yelling at me to run faster, pass it, etc...After recess we had lunch, also catered by the village. We were given a large pot of boiled potatoes and some cottage-cheese (except the curds were much finer) like lumps of cheese. You pretty much had to eat the cheese with a spoon. The kids also had this hot soup mixture of what looked like flour, provided by the Ministry. I'm glad they didn't offer it to me, because I don't think I could drink the water. 

After lunch, I showed the kids an activity on the XO called Turtle art. Essentially, its a program that allows you to program art. The teacher then asked me if I wanted to teach them the activity, of course this was meant with the large sounds of pleas and Si's. So I taught them how to make a square, which took about an hour. Partly due to their unfamiliarity with the machines, but also partly because the trackpads are extremely inaccurate. I tried cleaning the ones that weren't working, and this helped, but was still problematic. After I finished teaching them, around 1pm, the teacher and I had to leave to catch the bus back to town. However, not before we assigned them homework: multiplication/division sheet and to create a triangle with the XOs. Tomorrow I will teach them how to use eToys because it lets them create concept maps and also books. This is great because it will let them write and take pictures and paste them into the books. Then they can share the books with their friends. 

The teacher and I then departed and made the 30 minute trek back to the road. We caught a bus back to town. Now, I haven't been to China so I can't compare with that, but this had to have been the MOST CROWDED BUS I've ever seen on (and rode in). There was barely standing room, I stood the whole 1.5 hour ride back (took longer because it was a bus that had to stop). After a couple stops though, I realized there were also people sitting on top, who I had missed somehow. I swear this bus must have been carrying at least 2.5X the number of actual seats it had. Nothing like careening down a mountain road in an overpacked bus to keep you awake!

After we got back to Huaraz, I went back to my hotel and promptly took a 1.5 hour nap. Woke up, got some food, and prepared for the next day. Because tomorrow, it happens all over again :)

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Nobody in the schools that I have been to so far. Although this might change, I'm not sure. I think the earlier interns were working closer to the city of Huaraz, while me and the other two interns are traveling a much farther distance. 

No parts to repair. If that is the case I have to send in a report about that. Pretty much most of the fixes that I am doing is to the software. 

As for Spanish, its coming along. I've had to spend the past couple days teaching in it, but luckily the kids are patient :)

Sorry to hear the dogs aren't getting enough stimulation :-P]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was another early riser, although slightly later than yesterday. I got to wake up at 5am instead of 430am (its a small victory okay). I returned to the same village with the same teacher. We rode in the same cab, although today there were 4 of us in the truck space, it was extremely cramped, I couldn't even move. I'm just glad that we were the first ones to get out of the car. Also, I figured out the make of the car, its a Toyota Corolla extended hatchbak. They're extremely common here. The reason I checked is because our driver was adjusting one of his rims before we left, with a sledge hammer. Exactly. 

Today I spent most of the day teaching the children how to use the eToys activity. The teacher was extremely into the idea of having the kids learn more about the activities while I was there, especially concept maps. For the first half of the day, I taught them how to use the eToys activity to create books. This is a great way for them to combine pictures, text, and sounds. After recess, I taught them how to make concept maps (word bubbles with arrows). This they were able to understand quite easily and by the end of the class were helping each other make more complicated things. It is quite interesting to see how certain kids grasp the concepts faster than others. It's also really exciting to see them help each other and learn together. 

We were once again served breakfast and lunch. Breakfast consisted of a herb tea that is supposed to help with digestion (I don't know if that was a bad sign) and some herb-fried french fries, with a fried egg. It was extremely delicious. We had essentially the same french fries for lunch, but with rice, and also a herb soup with cheese. Also delicious. After lunch, class was ended and we trotted back the 30 mins to the bus stop. Luckily the bus wasn't as crowded today and I was able to sit in a seat, whereupon I took a nice little nap. 

Upon arriving back into town, I went through the street vendors and picked up some tangelos and plantains for all of about .75$. I then trotted back to the hotel to shower off because I was so dusty and sweaty. I turned in my clothes to get washed (1.80 per kilogram) and set about working on things for the next day. Tomorrow I'll be going to a different village, Yupash, for a day of festivities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Once again, I was up at 5am for the 6am car ride. It will be the same tomorrow. I was also once again in the back of the car, but luckily there were only three of us this time. I also found out the car isn't a taxi, but one of the teachers cars. Go figure! 

I was in a different village today, the village of Yupash. Its much larger than the previous one. As it turns out, only the primary grade has laptops and it was also a regional sports day for that grade. So rather than working with the laptops and the kids, we walked about an hour to another village where about 10 schools from the area met up for track and field events along with soccer games. Apparently, the most popular sports in Peru are Soccer, Track and Field, and Volleyball. The field was literally cut out of the side of a mountain and there were probably about 200+ people there between kids, parents, and teachers. It was really great to see everyone having such a good time. I took some pictures, got stared at accordingly, and chatted with the teachers. They all seemed to be happy to have me there, although when introducing me they prefaced the conversation by telling each other I don't understand much spanish. Which is slightly ironic that I could understand that part :). Either way, they were patient with me and spoke simply and slowly. While I butchered their language in return. For some reason, after having to speak so much spanish, my head literally feels like its going to split. Trying to force my brain to work in spanish is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole!

A few of the teachers and myself didn't stay the whole time, but rather left about half-way through so that we could return to Huaraz at a reasonable time. I think they did this for me, but I couldn't understand their spanish completely :/. The ride back was quite long, but I was glad to part from my new friends because my head hurt so much from speaking spanish all day. I quickly made my way to my new favorite restaurant Cafe Yurak-Jirka for my 5sole lunch. Then I quickly made my way to a cafe I had heard about and was pleasantly surprised. The name is Cafe Andino, and it makes California Cafe look small. Its a double story place with lots of comfy places to hang out. Its got good wi-fi, which is a necessity, and a nice library. Lots of backpackers come through, so there's always a person to catch a conversation with. It's nice to have a break and speak in english for a bit. Although the highlight of the day had to be the matron telling me I spoke good spanish, which was definitely an ego booster after having the teachers tell each other I didn't understand much all day :P

For the rest of the night I plan on working on various things and relaxing. I return to Yupash tomorrow for a day of working with the kids. Hopefully the teachers won't be too disappointed with my limited spanish! Although they were super impressed once I told them I was an electrical engineer. I think that may have changed what they thought about me, because I think they thought I was just a stupid gringo here to "work with the natives" but now realize I have a purpose and just because I speak spanish like an idiot doesn't mean I am one. I think it helped that the Director of the school has a son who is studying engineering, because once his attitude changed the others followed quite easily. 

Today was interesting, even though I didn't work with they kids, it was kind of a growing day. The teachers got to understand why I am there working and we found some common ground with which to relate. Right now, I feel as if I'm in the most difficult part because my spanish is getting better but isn't good enough for proper communication. I am looking forward to getting past the hard part and being at the point where we can carry on a good conversation. And I think so are the teachers :)

		<title>Sept 16 - OKay, Just teach! (Day 13)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Once again, I was up early at 5am for the 6am, 1.5hr ride in the trunk area to the village of Yupash. Today was a bit different because I had to teach two different classes, did I mention I'm supposed to be a Technical Intern, throughout the day. Literally from the start of class at about 8am in the morning to the 1pm end of the day I was teaching. Oh, did I already mention that I'm a technical intern? 

I taught the primary grade and then the younger version of the primary grade. I think the difference was between kindergarden and 1st grade, but I'm only guessing here. I worked with the older kids first. Literally the opening of class was as follows:

Teacher - "Good morning class. Today we have a special guest who is very knowledgable with the XO laptops. Give him a round of applause (I thank them). He is going to work with us today to learn some new things. Ok, go ahead and teach Jeff"
Jeff's Internal Brain Response - "Uh, what?!"

But I took to it like a duck to water. Although the kids were a bit quiet, I got them to open up a bit by making jokes in my terrible spanish. I asked them if anyone had any broken laptops, they didn't. So we went immediately into creating concept maps and books, like I did with the previous school. There were about 17 students though, instead of 5, so it was a bit more difficult to wrangle them. But somehow we got through both things. There were a couple students who got things much quicker, so I used them to help teach the others. I am thankful they were so open to doing so. For some reason, this group of students found making the books easier than the concept maps, the opposite of the previous school. Interesting huh? Anyways, around 11 we broke for recess/lunch. I got some food at the local restaurant (I use this term loosely). Then back to work with the younger group.

Now, when I walked in I could immediately feel a difference in energy. These kids were extremely upbeat and bubbly. They greeted me heartily and the teacher introduced me as follows:

Teacher - "Okay class, today we have a special guest, Jeffrey. Applause (I thank them). He  knows a lot about the XO's (they giggle in delight). Okay, Jeffrey, just go ahead and teach them about an activity."
Jeff''s Internal Response - "WTF? Again?" 
Jeff''s Verbal Response - "Uh do you have a preference?"
Teacher - "No"
Jeff's Internale Response - "Good thing I can improvise?"

Now I had been told the younger kids would be slower and not know as much, I soon found out how wrong this was. We started with some basic activities, which soon showed me that they were actually much more capable then their older counter parts. In fact they were so fast, they were discovering parts the programs faster than I could show them. I soon realized doing the maze activity was just not hard enough, they need more of a challenge. So then we worked on taking a picture and pasting it into Write, which took them about 5 minutes. Seriously, they mastered the clipboard concept that fast, wow! Okay, so that wasn't difficult enough. I immediately switched to the Turtle Art program, which was definitely a better speed. But, once again I was surprised that they found the examples (the program has about 15) in about 30 seconds. So I had to wrangle their attention back in, they were super enamored with all the different examples. We started work on created a rectangle, which they took to quite well. We were able to accomplish it relatively quickly (much faster than the first school). However, what impressed me the most were the girls in the class. They couldn't have been older than six, but they were absolute wizzes with the program. Creating the rectangle easily, mastering the program, and understanding nuances that I hadn't even mentioned. The boys were also extremely quick, but the girls were constantly running over to me saying "Were done, what next" Honestly, they were so good I was just about speechless. 

After the rectangle we made a circle, and while I couldn't describe the idea of angles and radius, because they were too young. This too they were able to do quite easily. The kids were so into it, that when the bell rang they didn't even notice. In fact, it was the other teacher telling us it was time to go. I really felt at the end of the session that these kids were going to be able to play with turtle art and master it on their own. A couple of the girls wanted to take their XOs home with them. I realized right then what I was seeing, these were girls that were mastering concepts and systems that would have been so far removed from them had they not gotten these laptops. They were building skills that will surely open doors for them in the future. I know it sounds sappy, but that's the truth. Their love of the system and excitement to use it, is the stuff that will drive them to succeed and excel in life in ways that would not have been available before. 

After the class, we piled back into the car (me in the back) for the drive back. In the car I couldn't help but think about the differences between the two classes and the teachers in control of the classes. The older group had a more reserved teacher who was quieter. The kids too were more reserved. The younger group had a teacher that never stops smiling and is a firecracker. The kids were similar in their interaction. It really made me think about how much influence one exerts around kids just by who you are. And while I'm not saying one is better than another, I am saying that what type of teacher you have can make a big difference in your development of interests and work ethic. 

Okay, so this has been a long post, but it was stuff on my mind all day. I'm really happy these schools are so open to me and excited to learn. Thanks to the school in Yupash and San Juan de Maqui, I hope that I've made at least some small helpful difference in your lives. I only hope that the great experiences keep coming and I'm up to the task. 

Upon my return to Huaraz I went back to my hotel, switched out the stuff in my back pack, and trotted off to Cafe Andino (the nice one I found yesterday). Won't do too much for the rest of the night except work. Tomorrow I'll be going to a school closer to Huaraz and don't have to leave until 9am, so maybe I'll wake up at 6am instead :P

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I didn't have to get up early for the 1.5hour car ride in the Cordillera Negra, although I was up at 6am. Now why was I up at this point? Because some person next door to my room decided they needed to play their guitar. Seriously. 

I ended up not having to leave the hotel until around 9am for a school only a few minutes from the town center. I ended up working with these kids (5 of them) that were just out of control. The teacher disappeared as soon as the laptops came out and the kids turned into a wild herd of cats. I couldn't really discipline them so I was struggling to find something to do that would really capture their attention. I went through a slew of things on the laptops and eventually found that I was able to keep them entertained using the Charlar (or chat) activity. We were able to set up a small chat activity between the kids and the concentration needed to use the keyboards kept them quiet for a while. Although the kids were out of control, I don't blame them. Rather, its the teacher who I think is the culprit. I didn't feel like I was able to accomplish much with the kids because they were too rambunctious. I guess not everyday will be a winner. 

After the school I went back to my hotel for a couple of hours to work on reports. Around 4 I went with the specialist (organizer) to talk with the teachers about my schedule for next week. Looks like I'll be out of touch during the week because I'll be staying in the villages. They are too far away to transit too and from. I don't know if I'll have any internet or what my living situation will be like. Things should be interesting :)

After talking to the teachers, I headed over to my new favorite cafe to hang out and listen to the Cal football game. A pretty quiet Friday night, which after my busy week, is just fine with me :)

		<title>Sept 18 - Monterrey (Day 15)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was able to sleep into 7am, but since my body clock was set so early, I couldn't get past that. The first thing I did was check the Cal-Nevada game (I had fallen asleep in the 3rd), and was saddened to see that Cal had been whooped. Sigh...

I ventured out to find breakfast, which consisted of bread and yogurt in the plaza de armas. This might sound nice, except for being bothered every 5 minutes by someone trying to sell you something. After breakfast, I went back to the hotel and packed my bag. I decided that I would venture down the road to Monterrey (15 minutes by Cambio). At Monterrey they have some baths (pools) fed by a springs. Instead, I choose to walk up into the hills directly behind the pools and spent about 1.5 hours exploring. Probably hiked up about 700 feet and then across the hill to a different one and back down. It was a nice little area with a small stream that runs through the area between the two hills (and feeds the pools). It's interesting because there is a concrete water aqueduct about 12inches wide and 15inches deep for delivering water from the beginning of the stream to different parts of the hill. This makes it possible for the people living in the hills to easily obtain water. 

After my hike I headed back to Huaraz, where I tried to visit the main museum. However, the lady that could sell me my ticket was on lunch, so the security guard said to come back in an hour. Really? I just headed back to my hotel to relax after my hike. After that I didn't do too much except work on various things and hang out. I'm storing up energy for my week ahead in the villages!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[****ATTENTION: Over the next week (M-F) I will most likely be out of contact (won't have internet). I sincerely apologize for this, but please know that if I do have internet I will make sure to post. Most likely I will not be able to do much until I return on Friday.****

Whoa, been here over two weeks. Feels way longer :P

Today was a nice easy going sunday. Got up and worked on some things until around 1030 when I couldn't ignore my stomach anymore and needed to go get food. I had decided earlier in the week that on Sunday I would treat myself to a nice breakfast. I headed over to the California Cafe, a popular backpacker hangout, for a good hearty breakfast. I got a two toast, home fries, scramble (cheese and ham), and tomatoes. Also orange juice and coffee/tea was included. It was a good amount of food, and it tasted GOOD. I decided to get the Coca Tea. Thats coca as in COCAine. That's right, the leaves are the same thing as that powder stuff (ok well not exactly). After drinking a couple of cups of the stuff, I definitely had a head buzz (which was not expected). I spent a good chunk of the morning at the Cafe working on my lappy.

Around 1230 I head over to the Archeological Museum. I went here based on the recommendation of my guide book and let me say that the book highly over exaggerated. This was about a 3 room and courtyard area of weak photos and few artifacts. This was definitely not worth my time or money. The museum back in Lima was much better. My recommendation for anyone in the area, don't waste your time. Go hiking instead. 

After the museum I returned back to my hotel for a bit. Worked some more and then headed out to find lunch. In addition to lunch I bought some mini bananas (10 for .3$) to snack on later and the next day. They are quite tasty. After lunch, which wasn't that spectacular because my favorite cafe was closed, I returned to the hotel to pack my things for the upcoming week and relax.

Tomorrow I will be up for a 330am rendezvous and ride of about 2 hours into the Cordillera Negra.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi all

Just a quick update tonight. The last week I've been in "el campo" or translated, the wilderness. More or less I went a week with minimal electricity, no running water, and no showering. I walked about 10 miles over the course of the week with about a weeks worth of provisions on my back to get from school to school. 10 miles isn't that bad, if it were flat. I was hiking up and down small mountains with probably a total elevation change of about 800 feet. 

Anyways, took a shower and ate some good food. I'll do a bunch of back posting with pictures tomorrow :)

Hope all is well with everyone!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sept 20 - To Quitaflor I Go (and to not return for a week)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow, so this was the earliest that I had to wake up in all my time in Peru. I was up at 2:45am for the 4am bus ride into the Cordillera Negra. I was lucky in that there were available seats on the bus so that I could sit with my large 70L backpack on my lap. I pretty much slept the entire way because it was so frickin early! A quick side note on the geography of Peru. There is a Cordillera Blanca and Negra. The Blanca is the one that you see pretty pictures of, it is covered in snow, a huge trekking destination, and a big outdoor adventure area. The Negra is a more arid area that gets little rain and seems to be covered in a layer of dust (including the people that live there) at all times. You canât escape it, the dust will find you. My best analogy is to imagine mountains with no vegetation except where there are farms. Huaraz is the town that sits in between them, hence its position as a great launching point.

Upon my arrival to Quitaflor, the school where Iâd be spending the day and night, we were treated to a breakfast of potatoes, rice, and instant coffee, with a side of rabbit and guinea pig. Everything is cooked in a mud/metal stove using wood as the fuel. The âkitchenâ area was a mud-walled and mud-floored shack with rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, and a cat cohabitating in the space. However, my insides have yet to melt, so I think everything was good.

After breakfast, we headed down into the school, which was down the âslopeâ about 500 yards. Going down was easier than coming back up in the afternoon.  Before the start of school, all the pupils were lined up an arms lengths apart (arms were used to measure :P ) and given the Ten-Hut command, then the at ease release. The director of the school gave me a brief introduction and then asked me to say a few words in front of the students. So in front of about 50 students I began to bumble my way through the speech.  It went along the lines: âHi, my name is Jeffreyâ¦uhâ¦Iâm here to help you with your laptopsâ¦umâ¦umâ¦If any of them are broken or have problems let me knowâ¦uhâ¦Iâm happy to be hereâ¦umâ¦I hope we can learn some new stuff todayâ¦umâ¦and so on.â Then one of the kids asked if I spoke English, I said yes I did, so then he asked if I could speak it to them. I raddled off a few sentences to keep them happy. It seemed to do the trick, because they started laughing. At this point, out of things to say, I wandered over to the director, where he seemed to understand I was finished. To recognize my effort the children serenaded me with a song in Quecha (the local tongue). After this the students disbanded and made their way into their various class rooms.

I followed the 1-2nd grade class where I would be working for the first part of the day, until after recess where I would switch over to the older group of 3-5th graders. I spent the majority of the morning fixing laptops, and the majority of the after recess session doing the same. However, I got to take a break at recess to join the kids for a game of soccer. They actually have a nice little court to play on. Since I was only going to be at the school for a day, the teachers asked if we could do an afternoon session to teach the children a new activity. I heartily agreed and we parted for lunch. In the afternoon the students returned to do a joint workshop. While we were waiting to get things started, I taught them English words by point at things on my body. They were extremely interested in knowing more English, although had some difficulty pronouncing a lot of the words. This is mostly because in English there are different sounds that just donât exist in Spanish. After the English lesson, we got started with the workshop. I worked on teaching them how to create books in eToys. The kids were extremely hard workers and we plowed ahead for about two hours, until it was just before it was dark.
After the workshop, we parted ways and I went to stay with the director. He gave me his room at the familyâs house. The room (see attached photos), consisted of a mud floor, mud walls, mud roof, and plywood door that was locked using a stick propped against the ground. The roof has plastic sheeting nailed into it to keep mud from falling on the person. This was only partly affected as I was awoken in the middle of the night with mud dropping onto my face. I tried to find the bathroom before going to sleep, no luck, so I just peed in the bushes.

Overall it was an exciting day, although unknown to me at the time, the first of many for the week.

Still to be added: Video of kids singing for me.

		<title>Sept 21 - A Gringo in Llanca </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up at 5am, although I was awake long before this due to the dog barking. I used the âwater spigotâ to wash off my face. I then gathered my things to wait for the 6am bus to the next town, Llanca. Upon arriving at Llanca, one of the teachers was awake and waiting for me. We chatted for a bit until one of the students showed up to take me to his house for breakfast. Breakfast consisted of French fries, bread, and a fried egg, plus some NesCafe coffee (with lots of sugar, which is how they drink their coffee).  I ate alone with the kids staring at me. 

I must interrupt my traditional story to describe some observations that I have made regarding the local culture. Most often I am asked similar questions by the locals. These include where Iâm from, why Iâm here, where Iâm going, and since their elections are soon they are also curious about our system and how it works. They are also interested in the differences in prices between here and the USA. The thing they find the most interesting though has to be my ipod Touch. They donât have ipod touches here, so it is a completely new piece of hardware. Additionally, I think I am one of the few white people for miles. I think the closest people are Hosh, who are in a different village. This makes me quite the oddity. Another thing is that Gringo is a non-offensive word. It is simply a term for white people. After living in California for such a while, this takes a bit getting used to. The last thing is that the majority of people cannot say my name. The sound is just difficult. So rather, I get called Joven (young guy) or Gringo (white guy). 

The teacher that I worked with today was a bit brusque. His method of keeping his class in-line was to yell at them. While this can be effective, it loses its bite after a while. Anyways, it became apparent that he didnât know how to use the laptop very well. The way he tried to make use of it was not the most logical. Additionally, he didnât know how to utilize back parts of the system. Nevertheless, we worked through things slowly, while he asked many questions. The kids were not quite interested because they were lacked discipline and I think, and this was probably a bigger part of it, any large amount of experience with the laptops. Once again, I was shown that the degree to which the kids learn is often tied to the teacher they have. 

I ate lunch with another family and was served a heaping pile of potatoes. I ate them all! After I returned from lunch, I worked on my laptop for a bit, until the professors finished their lunch. They then had a bunch of questions about all sorts of things. We spent the next few hours just working on the XOâs answering any questions and learning more about the activities. I think I really helped them in showing them what the system is capable of. This really helped to change the attitude of the teacher who wasnât very familiar with the system. 

After this was time for dinner. Once again, I had potatoes, rice and a fried egg along with some sugar coffee. After dinner I went to the place where I would spend the night. I spent about an hour talking with the SeÃ±or and SeÃ±ora about the laptops and lots of other things. The room I slept in was a step up in that it had a concrete floor and painted walls, plus a metal ceiling (no mud on my face while sleeping). I had to use the bathroom, and was shown to a shack with a hole; I decided to opt for the bushes for peeing again. 

Another interesting day, however, things were only to get betterâ¦

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was another day spent in the small village of Llanca. I was up at 6am, at the school by 645 to wash my face (remember I havenât showered yet) and this is a good time to begin another tale. It must be noted that up until this point, I have had no food except potatoes, rice, and fried eggs. Now if you know your food groups, this means I havenât had anything but starch (technically the egg is protein, but seriously?). Now this means something very important, no fiber and no protein (I donât count the egg) in my diet for the past few days. Think about what this might do to a personâs digestive system. If youâre thinking about the inability to use the bathroom (#2), then youâd definitely be on the right track. After washing my face, I tried to use the bathroom. Emphasis on tried, because I did not succeed. Now understand, Iâve never had this problem in my life. It was a new feeling trying to use the bathroom, pushing with all my might, eyes pooping, tears down my cheeks, and nothing. Absolutely nothing. It was very depressing.

After my failed attempt to use the bathroom, I was forced to eat breakfast. Can you guess what it was? YUP, potatoes, rice, and a fried egg, BUT there was also this delicious liquid cereal. I donât remember the name, but I think it was some sort of grain (like Quinoa) with sugar and water. Delicious! However, my happiness was quelled slightly by thought that my intestines were quickly running out of room. 

After breakfast it was back to the school for a day with the older kids. This group was much more savvy with the XOs, especially the teacher. We worked with the Charlar activity, using it to create a typing competition. It was really great. In the afternoon we worked with Memorizar. The students were able to play the game quite well, utilizing the mesh network to play together.

After the school day, I had lunch with another student, who lived quite a bit away. Once again I ate, yup, potatoes, rice, and an egg. They wanted to give me some more food. But I just couldnât eat it. My insides felt completely full. After lunch, I made my way back to school. I gathered my things and began my 3 hour trot to the next village. The two teachers accompanied me about halfway. I think I walked about 6 miles, including a 800 down/up in elevation. Needless to say I was completely wiped when I got to the next school. 

Upon my arrival at the next school of Mantuas, I found the parents in the school house drinking like fish. They (about 13) had gone through about 3 crates of 12 (1L) bottles. I was disturbed and impressed. Nevertheless, I was given a seat with a huge plate of food. Now before you think I say that Iâm going to have potatoes, youâd only be half right. I had Cuy (guinea pig) and potatoes with a pepsi. I ate all the meat, not because I wanted it, but in the hope that it might help relieve my bathroom issue. After dinner I ventured to the bathroom to give things a go. Now, I thought I had been pushing hard in the morning, but this put that to shame. I was pushing so hard, that I was burping up my dinner. Needless to say, I did not have any success. At this point, I was really getting worried. 

I headed back to the school room, to join in some beer drinking. The way they drink it is with one glass shared, passed person to person much as a joint would be (itâs the closest analogy I could think of, sorry Mom and Dad). After a bit, I was so tired I excused myself to sleep in the next room (storage room). 

If I thought I was to have a peaceful night, I was wrong. Apparently I had come down with a cold too. I had a terribly fitful night of night sweats and freezing. I had to get up multiple times to pee (not normal for me), although not for #2, which is what I was hoping for. Eventually I was able to sleep for a couple peaceful hoursâ¦

		<title>Sept 24 - Back to Huaraz (and a shower for the first time in 5 days)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I woke up feeling great. Because I had been able to use the bathroom yesterday, my appetite had returned. The cold affecting me seemed to have disappeared as well. But, and this really was the thing lifting my spirits the most, I would be returning to Huaraz for a hot shower and some different food. Because I was up early enough, I took a bunch of landscape pictures. I then washed my face and got ready for the school day. 

We worked with the kids by taking pictures of the outside and then annotating them. The kids seemed to enjoy it quite a bit and the day seemed to fly by. The teacher and myself had to leave around 12 to make it back to the other side of the valley and catch the bus back to town. It was a hard walk, mostly because once we got to the road, there were no cars. This meant we had to start walking towards the main town. Luckily a construction worker came by and was able to take the teacher (she is a mid-40s lady). This was good because it was hot and the walking was difficult. I walked for the extra hour to the town and then had to wait for another 30 minutes to catch a car back to Huaraz. 

Once back in Huaraz, I met up with Hosh and we all took showers. I used a whole bar of soap. Then we decided to go and splurge on a nice dinner to celebrate our return back to hot water. It was a nice dinner where we shared our stories. Hosh had been out for two weeks in one place, so no walking, but also no water for showering. We were all happy to be back in Huaraz and took a long time to eat. We then returned back to the hotel to crawl into nice, sheeted beds. 
And needless to say, that was the end of a very long and interesting week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Saturday and Sunday have flown by as Hosh and myself have tried to catch up on paper work and reports. We spent the majority of each day in cafes working and enjoying the fruits of the internet. We made sure to eat lots of non-peruvian food in anticipation for what will be coming this week. We had Thai food last night that was quite enjoyable, two american breakfasts, and pizza tonight. We feel we are ready to face the potatoes, rice, fried egg food for the next week. Luckily we will both only be working from Monday - Thursday, returning to Huaraz on Thursday. Also, Josh and Hope will be much closer to Huaraz, meaning they won't be spending the entirety of two weeks out in the village. 

Yesterday it also started raining, so today we made a point to go and buy rubber boots. This is in anticipation for the dust that will turn to mud when it really starts raining out in the villages!

I'll be offline again starting tomorrow until Thursday afternoon. I'll make sure to take lots of notes about all the interesting things that I'll be doing!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sept 27 - Back into the Cordillera Negra </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was back to the field work. I was up at 445am for the 530 cambio ride into the Cordillera Negra. The cambio was absolutely packed with teachers, and they found my hiking backpack odd and heavy, but thought I was well prepared. I can settle for that! I was even able to crack a joke in Spanish. One of the older ladies was talking to me about my schedule and a guy in the back wanted to make sure that she talked to me about my schedule. Well since we had already finished this, she tried to tell him that, so I chimed in and said we had covered it. It made the whole group laugh. I was happy to have been able to do that :)

The cambio ride was about 1.5 hours with another 45 minutes of walking. Iâm working in the village of Yurracancha, which has to be at 3300 meters at least. Itâs not so warm, plus it doesnât help that it is sprinkling off and on throughout the day. Overall the school day went by quickly, even though we only worked on one activity. The children reviewed a song in the morning and then had to type it into their laptops. While I can see the purpose in this, it took way too long and the kids had completely lost their focus after a while. I think weâll be able to work on something a bit more engaging tomorrow (or at least I hope so). 

The teacher is a nice guy and so is the lady that lives right by the school. Most of the kids live pretty far away, so its really just the school and the couple houses. Fairly quiet in comparison to normal. Lunch consisted of potatoes/rice and some grain soup. Not too bad overall, minus the repetition. It really started to cool down in the afternoon and standing outside trying to listen to election banter (mostly to work on my ear), got quite difficult. It must have been in the high 30s. Dinner was another type of grain soup with some bread (another staple in just about everything they eat). This is mostly for my girlfriend Liz, but the people that live right next to the school have two cats, both less than a few weeks old. They are extremely small and adorable. One likes to meow all the time, it reminds me of Zach (her cat). Iâll be sleeping on the desks in the school house tonight. Itâs definitely the biggest room Iâve ever had :)

No shower today. The toilet is a concrete hole :P

		<title>Sept 28 - From Yurracancha to Callanca (2 hours walking)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I got up around 615, which is actually kind of late. I rolled off my desk bed (which Iâll be sleeping on tonight, although in a different school). I went about getting ready for the day as usual. I packed my bags up because I was going to have to leave after school to walk to the next school. 

During the school day we worked with Memorizar. This was a good and simple activity that allowed the kids to spend some time getting to know the laptops. For some reason, they are really uncomfortable with them. Iâm not sure why, but it might be with how the teacher lets them use them. The kids probably need some open time to just play with and learn about the laptops. Iâm wondering if the teacher was trying to hide things from me or not, I wasnât sure. I got an interesting vibe that he might not let the kids use them that much, but I canât really prove it. Anyways, the day went by and soon enough the kids had to leave. I was able to get a bunch of pictures that I hope came out alright. I also got a few videos. We ate lunch and I packed up the rest of my stuff and headed on out to the next school. 

The walk back to Pira, and the hope was from there to catch a combi, took about 1.25 hours. The entire walk was at a slight incline. Once I got to Pira, they were having a bit of an election celebration. This meant a lot of people were in the town square, which I skirted. Needless to say, I got a bunch of weird looks for my bags and didnât stop to talk to anyone. Plus all the cars were there participating in the election stuff, so this meant I had to walk the extra 20-30 minutes to get to the school. 

Once I arrived at the school, and the small town (grouping of houses?), I searched out the person whose name I had been given. I found his house fairly fast, but then found out he wasnât there. His wife was completely surprised by my presence. She had no idea who I was, why I was there, etcâ¦So I explained my purpose, and she rallied to the cause, by helping me find the keys to the school (so I could sleep there). Then she went about finding some sheep skins (they look fresh!) and blankets for which I could use to make a bed on the desks. She set up dinner with one of the families and everything. This is pretty good considering I donât think she really wanted to help. 

Other than that I set up my bed, ate some food, did some reading, and generally relaxed after my hike (walk). This however brings me to another point. The city of Huaraz is a mecca for trekking and other outdoor activities in the cordillera BLANCA, not the cordillera negra. Either way, when people ask me if I will be doing trekking, I generally respond with the fact that Iâm walking to get to places, no more. Trekking will not be on my lists of things to do in my free time :)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I woke up today in the school house, on my bed of sheep (probably not killed long ago based on the feel of the hides :P) and slowly gathered my items. I didnât really need to pack everything up, but I did so that it was tidy. The teacher got here around 730am and we began with the kids. 

Since the class consists of four grades in one room and with one teacher (this is common to most of the places Iâve visited), I worked with the older kids first and the younger ones second. This was because they are at different stages of understanding and the tasks that we were having them do were different. With the older kids we worked in turtle art (4, 5 grade). With the younger ones we worked with TamTamMini, which is really a program that just lets kids click on things to make noise (1, 2 grade). Nothing extremely out of the ordinary, except for one student. This girl is an absolute whiz. I can show her something once, and she will immediately understand it and help the other students. Iâve got some great pictures of her, so you can she who she is. Her aptitude really blew me away and I hope that sheâll be able to take herself places with it (more on this a bit further down). 

The teacher left around 1pm to head back to Huaraz and I had a few minutes of down time. The kids left for lunch and I relaxed for a bit. The kids returned quickly though (quicker than I anticipated) and we got started on an afternoon session. We worked on a few new activities for them so that they could learn a bit more. My closest approximation to this experience is trying to teach a herd of cats to sit still and do tricks. What a task! Nevertheless we got through things fair enough and I sent the kids home around 445. I had a bit more time to rest before some of the students came back with their cousins. They had brought me some sugar cane, yum but too much work, to munch on. We talked, played some soccer, and I let them play on the XOâs some more while I ate dinner that had been brought to me. Oh and by the way, my meals were mostly the same again today, except for the slight confusion that caused double breakfast to show up, double lunch, and almost double dinner, luckily I was able to avert the over-fooding. That pretty much sums up the day, but I had some thoughts today that Iâve detailed below.

Thoughts on the girl who is super bright: She is awesome with the computer, and I have a feeling that this stretches to other things as well. She is quiet and eager to help. All one could hope for in a student. In short, the type of kid you want to help and see succeed. However, I am constantly wondering what chances she really has. While she does have the XO, she doesnât have access to the internet. I really wonder if sheâll ever be able to break out of the farm life, married and with kids before 18 cycle that affects many of the girls in the area. While I believe the XO is helping, I really do wonder its long term affects and ability to help kids elevate their lives beyond what their parents know. Which takes me to the next thought.
Thoughts on the older kids that came by later: Two students with their two older cousins came by after the afternoon session. I let the kids play on the laptops, apparently the two older ones (12-14) had used the laptops when they were younger and knew what to do. Seeing them use the laptops it was apparent that they knew how to use the laptop. But that is what they knew, how to use it. How to push the buttons. I have to wonder if what is being taught is how to push the buttons, rather than how to leverage the machine to work for them. I have really come to the conclusion that without the internet these laptops are nothing more than elaborate word processors. The kids arenât able to reach out into the world beyond and bring it to them. All they know is this is a cool piece of tech that nobody in their village has ever seen. This is not to say that I feel my presence isnât needed, but I think that the idea of just giving kids laptops in the hopes that they will become masters of it and their universe is indeed naÃ¯ve. That the laptop is the merely the tool, not the solution. 

Sorry to get all pensive, but when hiking from place to place, one does ponder these things. Below are some AWESOME PHOTOS that I got of the kids.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up again at 6am on my bed of sheep skins. Packed up my things and got ready for the school day. Once again, there was miscommunication and I was served two breakfasts. This might not sound like an issue, but you can only eat so much soup, rice, and potatoes before saying enough is enough. Either way, we got on with the kids and started the day without a hiccup. The older kids were to copy down a description from the board into their laptops. This was while the younger ones drew in their notebooks. Essentially, because there are four grades in the class, you have to set the kids to tasks to keep them occupied. This occupied most of the school day with the more keen younger kids joining in with the laptops. 
Since school only lasts until one, time tends to go by quickly in the class. I used today to also show the teacher a few things with the laptops. This is such that she will be able to better use them in the future. However, and Iâve mentioned this before, the method in which the laptops get used is very closely linked to the ability and aptitude of the teacher. In this case, the teacher did not know how to really use the laptop, and such the activities that she was assigning were not really appropriately designed for the kids. It is difficult for me to protest because I do not wish to injure the pride of the teacher and also I am not there long enough to outlast the teacherâs âassignmentsâ. Either way, the kids often do not know how to fully use the activities assigned, so I use the opportunity to expand their knowledge. I guess you could call this the compromise that I forge with the teacher (unbeknownist to them). 
After school, since this is election weekend, the teacher and myself walked the 25 minutes to the town of Pira to meet the other teachers and watch the election rally. In Peru, itâs common to have upwards of 10 candidates, so of course at the rally there were a couple bands. Of course, this means they play at the same time, so what was at one point indistinguishable music becomes a pure ruckus. Somehow the people can dance to it with intersperses of âSi Se Puedeâ or âYes we canâ. After an hour or so in Pira, we clambered into the Cambio (van) for the 1.5 hour ride back to Huaraz. I was in the back with little airflow, so it was hot and sweaty. However, this was not an issue, because I hadnât showered for about 5 days, so it didnât really make a difference. 
Once back in Huaraz, I accompanied the teachers to their candidate rally. We were able to wrangle some free beer and chicken, which was cool. It doesnât seem to matter what country you are in, but free food draws the crowd. After this I walked back to my hotel and met up with Hosh. I took a shower (the first in five days) and we went for a Indian/Mexican dinner served by a guy from northern Great Britain. He was an absolute character. Talked about his experiences with trying to do business with the locals and their inabilities to follow through. He was a bit frustrated, but full of good info. Iâll probably probe him for more info, as well as buy some of his sauces for the rice and potatoes that I will likely be eating. 
After a long dinner of meat and vegetables (things not found in the Peruvian diet) Hosh and I watched Toy Story 3 while surfing the internet (the drug not available during the week). On a side note, most Peruvians ask me if people in the US are vegetarians, I tell them no but that we eat more vegetables with our meals. I tell them we eat meat and other things as well. They find this odd and seem to think I am crazy. Either way, they think Iâm weird because I donât eat Guinea Pig on a regular basis, but that it is a pet. Itâs hard to explain the differences in culture sometimes. Back to the story, we relaxed and finished up the movie and called it a night. We have a few days of relaxing ahead of us that we are all looking forward to. We plan on visiting some thermal baths during the weekend.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Oct 2 we went to the Hot Spring baths by the town of Marcara and tried to hike to a lake above them. According to my guide book, this should only have taken about 1.5 hours. However, at the 1.5hr mark we were (according to the locals who laughed when we told them where we going) still 3 hours away. So we turned back, and since the "baths" were a putrid brown, we opted for cold drinks instead. After this we headed back to huaraz for a nice lunch. I found a place with the most authentic hamburgers to date. 

Sunday and Monday have been work and relax days. We spent both days in cafes (faster internet) doing reports and mentally preparing ourselves for the return to the cordillera negra. Oct 3 was election day and as a result most things were closed and people were filling the streets in support of their candidates. It was quite interesting. The weird thing is that its hard to distinguish between a happy and angry mob. We made sure to hide Hope to keep her safe (save the women I always say :)

Not much else to report beyond that. Tomorrow Hosh and me head back out into the Cordillera Negra for at least until Friday. This week we didn't have work monday due to disputed election results. Hosh will be at a fairly close school, while I will be traveling quite far. Hopefully I'll be able to make it back to Huaraz without too much difficulty. I'll have some walking ahead of me as well, at least an hour between places :P]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm going to try a format that is a bit different, instead of posting a daily post for the past few days that I was out of contact, I will post it all in one post with sections for each day.

<strong>Tuesday 10-5: 6 hour bus ride</strong>

On Tuesday I was at the bus stop at 730am. I met the teacher I would be traveling with and we boarded a bus. The bus finally left around 830am. I feel the bus deserves a bit of a description. In an effort to pack as many people as possible into this bus, all large bags were placed on the top under a tarp (although this barely helps with the dust). Medium bags fill the aisle, these are things like bags of grain, dog food, and other smelly items I couldn't identify. Small bags are stowed in the above rack, or if they won't there (mine didn't), then they go on you lap. At this point I had no idea that it would be a 6 hour bus ride. Either way, the bus trundled along its way, and after about 2 hours past all the sights that I knew. We continued past the furthest town I had yet visited, Pira, and up into the hills. At this point the teacher I was traveling with made hand motions that indicated we would be traveling over the hills and beyond. I smiled and nodded my head, all the while thinking "Are you serious?". The road itself was enough to make me crap myself. It is a dirt track barely large enough for the bus (albeit a small bus) to navigate, with a several hundred foot drop present on one side at all times. Either way we eventually made it to the town of Pampas Grande (described in earlier weeks by locals as "muy lejos" or extremely far, I now know why). We had a lunch of rice and potatoes, and they set me up in a room adjacent to the church. I was then left to my own devices. I played soccer with the locals at 5 or so, had a dinner of rice and potatoes, and contented myself to reading a book in my room. 

*Interesting tid bit, apparently the University of Richmond sends a group of students to Pampas Grande (<a href="http://news.richmond.edu/as/features/prehealth_peru.html"/>Article from UofR</a>, read the article about the description town, its a bit more rosy than my interpretation) every year in April to teach the kids english and to do other community related projects. The locals thought that was where I was from. I kindly corrected them that no I was not from there, no it was not close to california, and no I also wasn't a tourist (if I was, I'd be at Machu Pichu people). I explained I was working with laptops and schools, they seemed to understand.

<strong>Wednesday 10-6: Chorillos</strong>

On Wednesday, I was up at 6am and ready to go by 7. The teacher showed up at my room, and we did the 45min walk to the school. It was a small school of only about 12 students. They only had enough laptops for the six older students, so since there were about 4 grades in the class, I worked with the older kids so the teacher could work with the younger kids. The older kids (about 6 of them), were actually quite proficient at the laptops. However, like most students, they lacked extensive knowledge about activities. This includes the ability to search in wikipedia, how to highlight, change the size, color, font, and alignment of text in the writing activity, how to share an activity or create their own sets of flashcards. However, this group of students seemed to catch on quickly and we were able to make use of our only day together. After school, the teacher and myself trotted back to town (45mins, half uphill, think goat path). I ate lunch, and was reading a book, when I was interrupted by a yelling drunk (see video) in the town square. He kept it up for about 2 hours. I spent the rest of the afternoon reading a spanish book loaned to me by Josh (Breaking out of beginner's spanish by Joseph Keenan). 

A thing to note, the town of Pampas Grande is at about 12000ft. This means that at night, it gets really cold. I was wearing a hat, and multiple layers while in my room. Being inside didn't make all that much difference.

<strong>Thursday 10-7: No motorcycle = 2 hour walk to San Juan</strong>

Thursday I was up at 6am, ready by 7am, and at the teacher's house by 720am. The reason for this is that I was going to be visiting another school that day that was much farther away. The teacher was supposed to help me catch a motorcycle going in that direction. However, we did not find the moto and consequently I had to walk. We got to Chorillos after about 45mins and the teacher instructed me to keep walking on the road. So I kept walking, and walking, and walking, essentially everytime I reached a crest, I kept seeing more and more road. Eventually I had walked to the edge of the westward facing road, could pretty much see the coast lowlands, and the town was around the bend, facing completely west. After about 2 hours of walking, I was greeted by the teacher and a parent, and saw the moto I had missed parked at the parent's house. The guy said he didn't see us walking, I'm not sure how this could be because there is only one road. Either way, we got to the school and I was told there was only 4 students, and they had not had electricity for 15 days. This meant that none of the laptops had any battery left except mine. So we crowded around my laptop while I proceeded to teach them about searching in wikipedia and changing the text in escribir. Since I had to walk to the village and needed to be back in Pampas Grande by 2pm for the bus back to Huaraz (the next bus wouldn't be until Monday), I only had two hours to work with the kids. This had to include their recess the teach insisted they take. So school was over by noon. That meant it was a 1:1 ratio time walking to time teaching. 

I was fed a lunch of potatoes, rice, AND cuy (guinea pig). I was asked if I knew how to eat cuy (Yes Senora, I do) and if eating this food would kill me (No Senora, I think I will live). They seemed to find this funny. After lunch I got a ride back on the moto (YES) and packed my things to catch the bus. This time the ride was only 5 hours back because it more downhill than uphill. However, since the bus was much less crowded (by the way it was exactly the same bus) more bags went inside. Now, you are thinking, "Oh that's nice, less dust". And you'd be right, to a point. However, it was not for dust, but rather to make room on the roof for the pig and sheep that needed to go on the top of the bus. Now, if you've never watched (and heard) a pig and sheep hoisted up by ropes, then you are really missing something. The sound made by the pig gave new meaning to the phrase "Squeal Piggy". The sheep was more docile, hanging like a limp duck as it was raised by its neck. After these antics, the bus go on its way.

Over the course of the trip, more passengers were picked up and the pig almost escaped. We had to stop (which was a plus so that I could pee) to retie the piggy. The sheep just behaved and didn't do anything. I can't imagine having to ride on top of the bus for 5 hours through cold and dust. Either way, got back to Huaraz and met back up with Hosh. Did my typical long shower routine and got some chicken for dinner. 

Overall a short week of work, but definitely full of adventure. Next week I'll be back in the same area, but walking to schools farther away. Good thing I'm in shape :)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since my work week essentially started on Sunday, I will include that day in this post. Sunday was a nice relaxing day, I woke up, did some work, got a nice breakfast, and packed to get back on the 6 hour bus ride back to Pampas Grande. I was on the bus by 330pm, the bus left Huaraz around 4, and we got to Pampas Grande around 915. For about the first couple of hours I was seated next to an oversized (width-wise, then donât come length-wise) Peruvian man. Now, this wouldnât have been a problem except for the fact that it was hot with no windows open. However, it looked like he was as uncomfortable as I was, so I guess it was a wash. For sleeping quarters, the teacher and I slept on the bus since we were going to have to get up at 5am to make the trek down to the school. The bus was cold (the town is at 3600meters) and uncomfortable, I was actually glad to get up and start moving just to warm up. Also, I really mean trek because it was about 1000ft descending, with about 45lbs of crap on my back. Imagine a donkey trail with lots of rocks to slip on, with no light beyond the flash light on my head. 

By the time we got to school, my shirt was soaked and I was forced to change it out of necessity (I was getting cold). Also, since there arenât showering facilities, I put on some deodorant and called it good. Plus, the kids all smell worse than me, so I donât think theyâll mind. We had some breakfast and were working by 8am. I taught the kids a bunch of new things. The kids understood things quite quickly and were easy to teach. They were extremely quiet so sometimes coaxing answers from them was difficult, although by the end of the day it was getting easier. It also helped there were only three of them, only 4 total attend the school. We worked from 8-1, donât worry the kids got a 30 min recess at 1030, and then got a 2 hour break for lunch. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5084594540/" title="Students of Huanlla by Jpatzer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/5084594540_928e79fdc5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Students of Huanlla" /></a>

The teacher and I ate at one of the students parentâs house (the usual set-up), BUT the food was different. Somehow, the mother included beans in the rice and potatoes, AND cut up the potatoes to be bite sized (rather than whole), HOWEVER the best part was it had some flavor. She used something and there was flavor, and it was MAGNIFICENT! There was also soup and corn. Not too shabby. 

After lunch the teacher and I spoke for a bit. He was mostly curious, just asking questions about things in the United States. However, he wouldnât stop asking me about money I make, how much Iâm being paid, what Iâm paying for things, and so on and so forth. While this is normally uncomfortable, itâs definitely worse when you are trying to be discreet about your about the fact that your plane ticket costs probably as much as they make in a year. I actually saw a stat today that wowed me, the GDP in 2005 was 7$ a person in person. Iâm sure its gone up a bit by now, but either way wow.

Around three we worked with the kids some more until 5. I was shown to a room at one of the parentâs houses, which actually isnât too bad. Minus the fact that the bathroom is about 100 yards away and I have absolutely no idea where a spigot for water is. Meh, Iâll wash tomorrow, nobody here to smell me but myself (and after a while, you stop being able to do that, Iâm not sure if that is good or bad).

		<title>Oct-12: How much is in your bank account?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up at 6am and ready at the school doors by 7am. The problem was the teacher was still asleep. So I hung outside the school for about 15 minutes eating an orange until he opened the gates. I dropped my stuff, washed my face and hair (remember no showers) which temporarily tricks me into thinking that I am clean, and we went to go eat breakfast. 
Breakfast consisted of a rice, potatoes, some corn, cafesito (black sugary water), and soup. Fairly standard fare. Before school started, the teacher asked me if the laptops could connect to the internet, I said yes, then he asked if I could show him how. So I showed him and showed him in the large manual provided by the ministry of education exact instructions. I donât think that he had read much of the manual. Once again, it is the case that the laptops are being used at about 50% of their capacity. 

I worked with the kids from 8-1 in the activity eToys, making concept maps and books. When we stopped for recess around 1030 the teacher once again started pestering me about money and even flat out asked me how much I had in my bank account. Awkward. Either way, we had a two hour break at 1pm for lunch. We started again from 3-5 where we worked on charlar and scratch (my first group to do this with). At the end of the day the teacher told the students how lucky they were to have me and how I was paying for everything on my own. This surprised me, the paying for myself part, because this shed a new light on his money questions. For all I know he could have been asking these questions because he was concerned about me. So while I did feel awkward about his questions, it made me see them in a new light. 

Also, this teacher called me by a new title, Engineer. I get a butchered form of my name (from parents and teachers) or professor from the kids, but this was the first time I got Engineer or Ingeniero in Spanish. 

After school, I returned to my room to relax for a bit. At some point one of the students came to retrieve me for dinner. Dinner consisted of cancha, which is about half-popped popcorn, and some soup. There was also cafesito to top it off. While the food lacked much luster, the questions were interesting. They family, who Iâd eaten dinner and breakfast with before, finally opened up and started talking. They were mostly curious about English and how long it took to get here in a plane. This tends to be the usual fare or questions, however I got a different spin tonight that took me by surprise. As I was explaining how it could only take 12 hours and how it wasnât bumpy (remember all transportation here is by dirt road in a car or bus stuck in the armpit of the person next to you), one person asked how close to the moon we flew. Now think about that for a second, you live a life where the concept of the distance to the moon has never been explained. I was floored by the statement, but most of all, reminded why the kids and the all the people in general needed the laptops for things like Wikipedia. Where they can look up information that will completely change the way they view the world. 

Also, in case you are wondering, about whether or not I feel guilty about having more than a lot of these people, I do not. Now before you fire up the email to write me a strongly worded message, hear me out. My feelings on the subject of my relative wealth versus theirs, and the amount of wealth available in the world in general, is that the pie isnât finite. One cannot think of the amount of prosperity as finite, because it isnât. In fact, I think the pie is ever expanding. And the more education and knowledge you provide the faster it will expand. So while I do have more than these people, my work doesnât make me feel guilty about this, but gives me hope that one day they can have the same sort of âwealthâ that I am lucky enough to have. While that sounds optimistic, I canât think of any other way of phrasing it. So kids, next time your parents tell you eat your waffles because children in Africa are starving, tell them that your food going to waste wonât help them, but having your parentâs donate to help education in Africa will :P (Dear parents, please donât hate me for that).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up extra early at 530am and out the door by 615am. I was able to make the âshortâ trek to La Victoria in about 30 minutes, luckily it was early enough (cold enough) that I didnât work up too much of a sweat. Granted this was all downhill, so going back should be a bit more interesting. I will consider it a warm-up for the three hour walk to Pampas Grande. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5084592274/" title="Me and my pack by Jpatzer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5084592274_b38798995a.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Me and my pack" /></a>

Anyways, I arrived at the school, but I was a bit early. I ended up talking to one of the students, probing the kid for information on how much the use the laptops, when they use them, what they do with them, and so on. This is a good way to anticipate the type of day I have ahead of me. However, I got super lucky with this school, because the kids totally rock with the laptops. 

The teacher came around and was extremely enthusiastic. I got a really good vibe from her. She sent me on my way for breakfast after letting me drop my bags. We started class around 8am and I soon found out that these kids use their laptops a lot. They were extremely comfortable with them and so far were the most knowledgeable of any school Iâve visited. However, the still didnât know basic things like how to copy text and photos to the clipboard. Still, there were signs that these kids were pretty ahead of the curve. One girl (the teacherâs daughter) had an external usb mouse and the kids had already dabbled in Scratch and Turtle Art, two of the most advanced activities in the laptop. Either way, I was able to teach them some new things, and all of the kids were attentive and easy to work with, even the second graders. Once again, Iâve found itâs more about the teacherâs attitude than necessarily the type of kids in the school. If given encouragement and the freedom to learn, the kids will learn. 



Anyways the day went by quite quickly. At recess, when the kids are normally given their government provided PapaPan, it appeared the bread had not been delivered. Considering the kids needed to be able to focus and were probably extremely hungry, I divided up the loaf of bread that I had with me between the kids. I think it was the first time they had tasted wheat bread. Most of bread they eat in Peru is flour and water, nothing more. They call it Pancito (pan means bread and ito means cute or little) and I think this is because it has little flavor. On another note, I got to watch some bulls fight during lunchtime. The owner called it playingâ¦I describe it as a precursor to animal rage.

We took a break for lunch at 1. I accompanied one of the students to their house for lunch, coincidentally the house with the bulls. They are a nice family and the dad insisted I watch a running of the bulls video with him before I left. This was essentially their version of youtube. We watched people get trampled and gored. Eventually he told me that they have a ârunningâ every year in the village. Iâm glad it wonât be when I am around for it. 

After lunch I worked with the kids again from 3-5pm. The time flew by considering they were learning new things and really were interested in learning. After class, I played with the kids a bit, soccer as usual. I talked with the parents a bit and eventually was shuttled off for dinner. The teacher, her daughter, the matron who cooked dinner, and myself had a nice chat after dinner. We talked about all the deadly things they find in their houses, like snacks and spiders. Luckily, Iâm sleeping in the school house tonight, which is mostly concrete, so I should be a bit safer than the mud hutsâ¦hopefully. Also, I offered to help make dinner, which was greeted by hearty laughter. I think that men just about never do any of the cooking. Shoot, in some houses Iâve visited only the guys eat at the table, while the women eat near the stove on the ground. Please donât hate me feminists, Iâm just telling it as it is, and most of the time this isnât the case. 
After the meal I meandered the 500 yards, or the length of the town, back to the school to get ready for the next day and go to sleep. Overall, a very productive and rewarding day, hopefully tomorrow goes the same way!

The whole class

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up around 6am and ready by 7am. By 710 one of the kids had shown up to escort me to his house. I took a picture of his shirt because it was John Cena, and not only was this awesome but also totally baffling as to how that shirt ended up in Peru.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="John Cena! by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5083948015/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5083948015_bb5a1652a3_z.jpg" alt="John Cena!" width="480" height="640" /></a>
<em>John Cena!</em></p>
After breakfast, it was to work with the kids. We worked on a variety of activities and since this group was so quick, I had actually prepared new material the night before. We did a quick review to reinforce concepts, then we worked on some new concepts. However, the power disappeared around 9am and consequently we were out of batteries by 1030. So, we took a recess for an hour, but upon our return, the power had yet to return. Therefore, I got inventive and did a english language workshop. I drew a picture of a person (okay, it was a stick person) on the board along with labels for body parts. Then we played a simpler version of Simon Says. The seemed to like it as they continued to be confused. We kept this up for about 3o minutes, when miraculously the power came back on. We were able to work for another 30 minutes on the laptops before the end of the day.

After class, I ate lunch quickly and grabbed my bags for the walk to Pampas Grande. Jhonaton, a super inquisitive and nice kid, accompanied me for about 1.5hours of the journey.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Jhonathan by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5084553164/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/5084553164_e52287859e_z.jpg" alt="Jhonathan" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Jhonathan</em></p>
I had to walk first back to Huanlla to meet up with the teacher there. I got to take a quick rest while he got his things together.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Resting by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5083943649/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/5083943649_4d047670b8_z.jpg" alt="Resting" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Resting</em></p>
From Huanlla we made our way slowly up the mountain, all 1200m of it, to Pampas Grande. We had to stop to take a couple breaks because the paths are extremely steep. Plus, I was carrying two packs, one with my living stuff and the other with the tech stuff. I was able to find a couple of sticks to help with the walking business, however walking still got slowly got more difficult as the day wore on. Somehow the teacher manages to do this weekly. I think I'd kill myself first.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Hike by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5084532054/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5084532054_d558b824f1_z.jpg" alt="Hike" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Hike</em></p>
We got to Pampas Grande around 6, and since the teacher had a stomach ache, we only had tea and bread for dinner. The bus was scheduled to leave around 2am, so we clambered in and slept for a bit until it did. This was about 730pm. By 1130pm I was wide awake, freezing (remember Pampas is at 3600m) and starving. To add to this, I think the blanket they gave me had fleas, because I was extremely itchy. I busted out my camp stove and made oatmeal. The teacher thought I was crazy, but I did not care. After the food, I was able to fall in and out of sleep until the bus started filling up with people for the trip to Huaraz. I got back to Huaraz around 730am where I promptly made for the hotel so that I could take a shower. One has to realize, the paths we are walking on are full of dust and when you sweat, dust sticks. I looked and smelled terrible. This was probably the reason I didn't have anybody sitting next to me on the bus....
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Hobbits by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5087439919/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5087439919_d0682def99_z.jpg" alt="Hobbits" width="640" height="425" /></a>

		<title>Oct 16 - The Beautiful Llanganuco Lakes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today Hosh and myself did a bit of touristing. We went to go see the Llanganuco Lakes at the foot of the largest mountain in the area Huascaran. Unfortunately the mountain was covered in clouds, so we couldn't really get any pictures of it. However, the lake was quite beautiful. It changes color throughout the year; it was green when we were there. To get there we opted to not do an organized tour from the many companies in Huaraz, but choose to take a combi to Yungay, the town below the lakes, and then a cab from there to the lakes. There are lots of combis from Huaraz to Yungay, about an hour, and lots of taxis hovering around to take you from Yungay to the Lakes, also about an hour. Overall it saved us about half of the cost of a trip through a tour agency. Plus this way we got to have the 'adventure' of local transportation. Overall it was a pretty relaxing day of tourismo (spanish term). 

The lakes

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up extremely early, like 2:45am early. While walking to the bus, I saw this - 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5107394134/" title="Sex Burger by Jpatzer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1097/5107394134_eee3942e3e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sex Burger" /></a>

I was on a bus that was leaving Huaraz by 4am and in Pariacoto at 715am. I had put my backpack in the back compartment of the bus, which I had thought would be better than on top in terms of dust, but oh how wrong I was. I pulled my backpack out to find it absolutely coated. Note to self, donât do that again! Well I did what I could and brushed off my bag, then went about hunting down directions to Vinchota. Vinchota, the town I will be working in over the next two days is just outside of Pariacoto by about a 40minute walk, uphill and in what is best described as a desert. Needless to say I found the directions from some locals, confirmed along the way, and was able to meander my way to the school. By the time I arrived I was soaking wet, because the sun was up and it was quite warm. So I changed shirts, put on some more deodorant, and called it good. 

The teacher greeted me at the door and promptly informed me that he had seen me walking as he was driving his moto to the school, but wasnât sure who I was so didnât stop to give me a lift. Well, whatever, I got to the school it not fashionably late, then fashionably sweaty. I soon found out that he only has 8 students, but 5 of them are missing, so this really means that he has 3 students, all under age 8. This means that basic things like using the mouse are a challenge. However, did I let this stop me from dominating in the teaching realm? No, it did not. 
We worked with a variety of activities, and I use the word worked loosely, struggled through is more like it. But we got through them, they learned some new things and by lunch time all parties were in need of a good nap. I caught a ride with the teacher back in his moto, which was easier than walking, although significantly more nerve racking. 

We made it back to town without any hassles and I was shown to a place for lunch. Luckily it was restaurant, so the normal potatoes and rice was a bit more spiced up. I even got a piece of pork, yum. I went back to the room I was given, at the auntâs house, to take a nap (remember I got up early, donât judge). After my nap I took a 10min walk around the town to see it, this is all that was required because itâs not very large. I, of course, got stared at by everyone which is normal. I just try to look friendly and hope they assume I am. I think mostly what they are contemplating is âWhere the hell did he come from?â, sometimes I wonder the same thing. 
Either way, I grabbed some dinner which was more of the same fare. During dinner a local was talking to me about how Pariacoto is the best city on earth. They have the best apples. They have the smartest people. BUT, and I mean BUT, the government doesnât help them. So they canât develop a industry for their amazing apples. And their super smart people canât get educated because they donât have a university. Essentially, if the government did something, Pariacoto would take over the world. His solution was to have a new library built so that theyâd have better books. *On a side note, I havenât seen anyone reading for fun. No one.* I tried to explain that they have the internet, which is better. However, I donât think he understood that. Anyways, interesting conversation nevertheless. 

After dinner, I headed to the teacherâs house to confirm details for the next day. What I found out is he also happens to run the town radio station. I got to see their set-up, which would make any aspiring rapper in the south proud. They have egg cartons on the walls to dampen sound, a very small sound mixing board, and an extremely old PC for playing the songs. It is impressive actually that they run a radio station out of the guyâs living room essentially. His bed is behind a sheet! However, what this put into perspective was why he has a car (albeit it is broken down at the moment) and a moto. Heâs a teacher during the morning, and a DJ during the afternoon.  Which is a great idea considering that most of the teachers only work half a day most of the time. I am never failed to be surprised, just when you assume one thing, you find out its completely different. After touring the âstationâ I headed back and went to bed early.

Today was pretty standard. I got up around 6am, got ready, and was out the door around 7am. Today, now that I knew who the teacher was, I was able to ride in his moto-taxi. This was pretty fun (scary), I was able to get interesting video of it. The teacher brought his 9 year old son along so that he could spend the day learning with me. I worked on various activities with the kids, splitting the 4 kids into two groups (older and younger). This way I could tailor activities appropriately for their age group. The day passed smoothly enough and soon we were heading back to Pariacoto in the moto-taxi. I grabbed lunch, played with the teacherâs son a bit, walked around the town some more, and settled in back at my room to read a bit and work. I ate a snack with the teacher and chatted with him a bit. A real nice fellow. 

I headed back to my room to get ready to leave in the morning and went to sleep. Overall a fairly quiet, non-crazy day.

		<title>Oct 20 - Boulders roll downhill, don&#039;t stand in the way</title>

Today turned into an interesting day. I was up at 530am and out the door at 615am. Now, why was I up at the time when most people are still contemplating rolling out of bed to make coffee, well itâs because I was on my way to the next village. I needed to travel from Pariacoto to Racrao, which by foot is about an hour (something I would find out later in the day), but only about 10 minutes by Moto-Taxi. I had been told there was a combi or busses to be had, however, after waiting for about 15 minutes at the âcurveâ I had only seen moto-taxis. I therefore flagged one of these 3-wheeled guys down and jumped in. We took off down the road, coasting on the downhill sections to save gas of course. The thing that struck me was how green the land was becoming. The road is flanked by apple orchards and lots of other fruit plants. The green of course only surrounds the river, but nevertheless, it is in stark contrast to the extremely dusty areas I had already visited. 

I arrived at the small down, think outpost, where I clambered out of the moto and became the immediate center of attention of the people hanging around. I am not unused to this since it happens just about everywhere. I asked for the teacher and was directed to her room, it was a small trudge across the street. I related my story, she vaguely knew who I was, and I was told that I could accompany her students to the school. I crossed back across the street to the group of snicker students, and they promptly began walking to the school. After about 30 seconds I realized the school was not close, but rather up about 300 meters of steep incline. Apparently half of the town is next to the road and the other is up on the ridge, connected by a trail that reminded me closely of the Grand Canyonâs trails. Either way, we trudged up the hill and all arrived panting at the school. 

I was greeted by the second teacher at the school. He began talking to me like I was a Neanderthal, using large arm gestures and grunting noises. Luckily after a bit of talking he realized that I understood Spanish and promptly began communicating using his words. This was nice because it was actually harder to understand him when he was not speaking but merely motioning. I began the day working with the older students and would spend the whole day with them. As usual, the students had recess and they wanted me to play hide and seek with them. So I obliged and we began to hide. Since the school is on a hill, many of the hiding spots are on the incline. Well, I was making my way over the boulders when suddenly they gave way beneath my feet. I very quickly found myself on the downhill side of a large keg sized boulder. As I was trying to regain my footing while sliding down the slope, the boulder was bouncing against my back (not an enjoyable sensation). Luckily I was able to find some footing, spin around with the agility of a mountain lion, and parry the boulder to my side. I then watched it continue to roll down the hill for another few hundred meters. With my back itching with pain from having been smashed a few times by a boulder, the children quickly began to check about my safety. 

At this point I must digress for a second, when I was about 10 my dad was playing baseball with me, my brother, and a bunch of other kids. At one point a kid tried to catch a ball in front of my dad, this kid is now in jail I believe (coincidence?), and due to his bad judgment the ball tipped off the glove and promptly smacked my dad in the face. This instantly broke his nose and sent blood spraying everywhere. My dad, a veteran of broken noses (this was his third), went into the community center and reset it. Then we finished the game. I donât tell this to describe how tough my dad is, but rather to describe the stubbornness that I was taught to show in the face of pain and danger. Should my dad have gone to the hospital, probably, did he? No, not immediately. He did go later, and had to have surgery to add cartilage back into his perennially broken nose. However, the idea is that things shouldnât stop because some serious injury has been sustained. 

Back to the story at hand â Now, this is not to say I was in life threatening danger. But my back was a bit bruised. However, did this stop us from hiding and playing the game. No, it did not. We finished the game, and I finished the day teaching. Did I sleep on my side that night, you bet! (BTW my back turned out to have only scratches, and my shirt got really dirty, but whatever, I stayed hidden)

After school, I was to stay with one of the teachers (the second one I had met) in his room at the valley bottom. So we hoofed it back down to his room. He then informed me that since we had to travel back to Huaraz Thursday, we needed to go to Pariacoto to get me a ticket. As we began the walk back to Pariacoto, I could only help but think about how I could have bought a return ticket the day before. However, as I have learned in life, nothing is easy (nada es facil). While in route to Pariacoto it began to rain. So now we were walking in the rain (luckily it was a light rain). After about an hour of walking we go to town, got my ticket, and then the teacher told me that his wife was coming back to town that day. He wanted to wait for her. It was about 430pm at this point. We meandered over to the medical clinic and sat in their doorstop, until 7pm. A little under 3 hours of waiting. Eventually his wife did show up, and decided that, especially since his 4 year old daughter had come with us, that we would take a moto-taxi back. 

Around 8pm we were finally back to Racrao. Since the teacher lives in one room, with his wife (when sheâs home and not working), and his daughter, things were a bit small. They wanted to give me their bed, but I vehemently protested and we hauled in a mattress from another room and I slept on the floor. There was no way I would allow the people that were feeding me and letting me into their home to give up their bed. I did not mind the mattress one bit and actually found it quite comfortable, when on my side. It turns out that like all young kids, their daughter only watches two movies (over and over): Barbie the Three Musketeers and The Little Mermaid. So we got to watch both of these before sleep. I canât believe Disney made Ariel 16 years old, thatâs just not right. 

Anyways, after a long day sleep was very welcome. However, before I conclude I have to say that the teacher and his family were extremely welcoming and I am extremely grateful for all they did to make me comfortable. I know they do not have very much, but their hospitality was astonishing and I am extremely grateful. I owe them many thanks (which I tried to convey in my measly Spanish), and only hope was successful.

		<title>Oct 21 - Back to Huaraz on the road of death</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up with the teacher and his family, remember I am sleeping on the floor, around 530am. We prepared breakfast, washed up, and by 715am we were trudging up the hill to the school. Today I would be working with the younger group of kids, but the older class would also be joining us to help give them a chance to review more things (also their teacher had left the night before). To help the younger kids, I paired them up with older kids who could help them. We worked through a variety of things and by the end of the days the kids were exhausted but tired. During recess, I decided not to join them for hide and go seek, since my boulder incident was still fresh in my mind. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5107355024/" title="_DSC0008.jpg by Jpatzer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1423/5107355024_11de395e91_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" alt="_DSC0008.jpg" /></a>

After school, we trudged back down to the teacherâs house. I was fed an extremely large lunch by the teacher and his wife, so much so that I had to take a quick nap! The teacher and his wife were packing up for the trip to Huaraz, so I mainly just watched The Little Mermaid with their daughter. We were out the door around 4 to catch the bus back to Huaraz. The bus traveled from Racrao to Pariacoto, where it stopped for about 30minutes. I used this opportunity to use the bathroom (this is important for later in the story) and walk around a bit more  Around 445pm were out of Pariacoto and on our way back to Huaraz. 

The ride back is on a precarious mountain road where they are doing construction. However, does this make the driver slow down or to take more caution, no, it does not. He plows through construction sites, past trucks, skimming all within inches. Needless to say after enough of these near-collision encounters, I was extremely glad I had already used the bathroom, or I might have crapped my pants at some point. Luckily, and surprisingly, we made it back to Huaraz alive and I made my way to the hotel. Before the teacher and I parted, he invited me to his house on Sunday for duck, the ducks we had brought back from his farm. Iâm excited for some fresh Peruvian duck!

		<title>Oct 22 - Teach the Teachers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I arrived at the hotel last night, Hope and Josh informed me that we were to be teaching a workshop for teachers today (Friday). Therefore, instead of sleeping in, I was up at 6am and ready for our 8am departure. The specialist Capistrano picked us up and we walked to where the workshop was going to be held, in a school nearby. 

Before things got going, the Specialist was showing some students features of the laptops

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5106739161/" title="_DSC0026.jpg by Jpatzer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1175/5106739161_41b9d3c476_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" alt="_DSC0026.jpg" /></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5106733671/" title="_DSC0027.jpg by Jpatzer, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1337/5106733671_2fb9563b75_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" alt="_DSC0027.jpg" /></a>

Many of the teachers who I had already worked with were present, as well as new ones. It was good to get to see everyone again. Capistrano started things off explaining all the things the Hosh and I had done. He went into intricate details about how there was no place I couldnât go, that I would reach anywhere, without fault, the only thing I was missing was a lady friend, and that I go âWHERE THE DEVIL WONâTâ. After such an introduction, how could I follow that with a workshop?! 

There were about 35 teachers in this one room. Hosh and myself, launched into a variety of workshops, going over many activities and answering a plethora of questions. It was like herding cats, trying to start activities, explain, help, and do any other thing that was asked of us. By the end of the workshop, we were all exhausted and very hungry. When things wrapped up at 1, we trudged off for lunch. After lunch we had a nice break, relaxing in the hotel. I eventually had to go out to buy a bus ticket for Sundayâs travels. Josh and I also arranged to go for a bike ride the following day (Saturday). We both knocked out early, in preparation for our 7am departure the next day.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Josh and I were up early at 6am and out of the hotel around 650am for out 7am departure. Today we went mountain biking in the hills. It was amazingly fun. Josh did great, considering he had little mountain bike experience. I flew over my handlebars at one point, which was exciting. Our guide was great. The routes are essentially down through fields, roads, and walking paths. It was technical at places and easy at others. Josh and I both had a great time. Weâve made a deal with the tour company to make some promotional video and photos for them in exchange for future service. Weâll be shooting a mountain bike video next weekend with my Nikon D90. It was a very fun day, and despite both of our sun burns, our grins havenât disappeared.

For those interested, in case you come across this blog during research, Josh and I went with Galaxia Expeditions. They were not the cheapest, but they had their act together the best. In the future, we will probably hire our guide directly. However, Galaxia Expeditions has a great setup, and while you will pay a bit more, they won't do you wrong.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Oct 24 - At Peruvian Birthdays they sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; in English</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today Hosh and me were invited to the teacher from Racrao's mother-in-laws restaurant for a birthday celebration of an uncle. The restaurant is located right next to the trout farm in the city. Seriously, its a trout farm where they raise fish for consumption in the area. The only problem is that they only way Peruvians cook their fish is fried, or Trucha Frita, which defeats the purpose of the tasty trout in my opinion. Anyways, we did not eat Trout despite our proximity to the farm, but rather were served duck. The ducks that I had help pack up three days ago. Along with the duck was potatoes and rice (I swear its in every Peruvian dish). The duck itself was not the most tasty I've ever had and I think I much prefer Liz's Grandma's recipe. I ate all the duck though and everything else. I have no fear, plus I don't want to be rude. Our main course was followed by a serving of two deserts!  We sang Happy Birthday, in English, which threw me off, but luckily I knew the words. This makes me think of all the wasted time learning to sing that song in Spanish. Bleh! Luckily Deserts, Peruvians know how to get right. After lunch we all were sent into a comatose due to all the food. Overall quite an enjoyable afternoon. 

I leave to go back into the field tonight and won't be back until Friday most likely. It's a 3 hour bus ride tonight, plus a few more hours tomorrow morning. I'll take great notes so that I can provide inspiring and comical posts next weekend :)]]></content:encoded>

<em>Isaac and his XO laptop
</em>

âHow do we know what weâre doing is actuallyâ¦doing anything?â Jeff asked at dinner. I tried to cut my chicken with a dull knife and didnât know how to answer.

Josh chimed in, âYea, I mean these kids are always hungry. Girls have babies when theyâre fifteen. Itâs just the way it is. How do we know that handing them a laptop is even going to change anything?â

I place my knife on my napkin and fold the corners, as if napkin origami would give me a clue. I shrug. âWe donât. Thatâs the hardest part of service. We donât know if our work is actually making a difference. You just have to do as much as you can and let other people figure it out from thereâ¦â

Still stirring from this conversation the week before, I wake up to the usual rooster call. Jeff, Josh and I are teaching computer skills on special educational laptops in rural Peru with One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), and today Josh and I will lead workshops in a little mountain town called Colcabamba. The current of chilly morning air runs through the thatched roof, and I begrudgingly begin to peel the layers of alpaca blankets off my warm body. The dirt floor feels cool against my feet. Whereâs Josh? I wonder.

âGood morning sunshine!â he yells from the outside. Josh is always up before me. Since we donât have a bathroom or a sink, I wet my fingers with a capful of bottled water, pop in my contact lenses using the rusty mirror, and dump the water on the dirt floor. Then I grab our little green laptops and hurry down the steps.

Every morning, a different member of the community invites us to breakfast. Today, we wait outside a mud house with a bamboo roof that belongs to the director of the 19 student school. A shaggy dog sleeps at the gate. âShould we knock?â I whisper. âAnd break down the door?â Josh laughs, pointing to the hastily nailed together 2 by 4s in front of us. Finally, we hear footsteps. Itâs Mario, our five-year-old buddy who remembers every English word we teach him, enjoys sliding down dirt piles, and never gets bored of hide-and-go-seek. âHurry up!â he bring us inside, grabbing my two fingers with his hand.

âGringitos!â His grandma stares at us from the kitchen and mumbles something in quechua, the indigenous language. âWhat did she say,â I whisper to Mario. âShe asked what you are doing here,â he explains matter-of-factly. I wonder the same thing.
<h2>âShe asked what you are doing here,â he explains matter-of-factly. I wonder the same thing.</h2>
<strong>
</strong>

We duck into the smoky room, where guinea pigs squeak around our feet, and the smell of stew wafts from a giant pot on the fire. The director has prepared a table with tea and crackers, but Mario whips out a stick of sugar cane instead. He gnaws on one end and peels away the husk with his little teeth.

âHere, take some for later,â he offers, passing me a piece. I roll it around curiously in my fingers, and the teacher notices. âYouâve never seen sugar cane?â she asks. No, I shake my head. âItâs a lot of work to eat,â she explains. â<em>Hay que pasar la parte dura para disfrutar un poco dulce.</em>â You have to get through the tough part to enjoy a little bit of sweetness. But, according to Mario, itâs worth it.

My cell phone blinks 7:30, and I realize itâs time to head to school. We put our dishes in the sink and walk down the hill with the director. We will spend the first hour with the first and second graders. Theyâre not easy to teach, in part because they have short attention spans, and partly because they donât understand concepts like highlighting text or using a cursor.

The kids hurry into their seats, chirping in unison, âBuenos dias!â Josh and I distribute the laptops and help the students plug them in. As we are getting settled, a little boy with sunburnt cheeks and ripped clothes shuffles in. The kids stare silently. âItâs Isaac,â they whisper to each other. Weâve only been at the school for a few days, but this was the first time Iâd seen him. âHi Isaac, Iâm Esperanza. Weâre going to work with computers today,â I kneel down and hand him a laptop.
<h2>Isaac doesnât smile like the other kids. He seems lost, like a confused and weary traveler who got off at the wrong stop.</h2>
Isaac doesnât smile like the other kids. He seems lost, like a confused and weary traveler who got off at the wrong stop. As Josh teaches the children how to use a simple paint program to practice their shapes and colors, Isaac stares at his computer. I show him how to click on a shape and draw it on the screen. He doesnât flinch. I draw a heart and fill it with red. He just blinks. Maybe heâll respond to numbers. I ask him to find the 7 on the keyboard. He takes his finger from his mouth and presses on the N key. âWhat is this called,â I ask, pointing to the heart on the screen. Nothing. âOkay, letâs try to make a square,â I suggest, as the other kids paint elaborate rainbows and outside scenes.

Finally, he taps the touchpad and makes a tiny square on the screen. Something changes in him. His eyes grow wide, and he jumps up from his desk. Carrying around his laptop, he proudly points out the square to everyone in the room. âYes, very nice, Isaac,â the teacher says, leading him back to his chair. âIâm shocked he even showed up today,â he tells us while the kids work. âWe havenât seen that boy in months. His parents never went to school, so theyâd rather have him work in the fields. I think he only came because he heard weâd be using the laptops.â

We spend the rest of the day doing workshops and teaching new concepts like logic and world geography with the computer programs. As the last bell rings, I canât help but reflect on Jeffâs question. We donât shower for two weeks, we live in a mud hut, our clothes permanently smell like animals, and we donât even know if our work is worth anything. The students are always attentive and enthusiastic, but I wonder if they are more excited about their new âtoysâ than they are about learning new things. Kids like Isaac will probably never go to high school or dream about bigger things. What are we really doing here?

I wonder if taking one little stepâlike showing Isaac how to make a squareâmeans heâll come back to school. Iâm encouraged that we reached him, but is it enough? I wonder, as I play with the piece of sugarcane in my pocket. It feels rough and splintery; itâs hard to believe that thereâs sugar inside. Teaching here is a lot of work, I think. <em>Pero hay que pasar la parte dura para disfrutar un poco dulce.</em>

		<title>Oct 25 - No electricity? No problem! (at least until the batteries run out)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monday for me, technically started Sunday night. I was one a bus around 8pm for the 3 hour ride to Pariacoto. While most people on the bus were sleeping, I would not be that lucky. I was stuck next to this obnoxious lady that would not shut up! Everytime I was able to pass out, she started yapping again. Sigh, no sleep for me. We arrived in Pariacoto around 11 and I went to the Directoraâs house, this is also the radio station I talked about last week.  I slept on their couch until about 430am in the morning, when we had to get up so that we could take a cab to the school. The cab ride itself was 2 hours up into the hills, with me bobbing in and out of consciousness due to the small amount of sleep.

We finally got to the end of the road, theyâre extending it now, where we all bailed out. From there it was another 45min walk to the actual town. At about 7am in the morning, this definitely woke me up and got my blood pumping. We got to the school, and I had breakfast with the Directora. On the walk over they had told me that there was no electricity in the school (or whole little town for that matter). Additionally, they also have three classes and about 32 students. Needless to say, these are a few problems for one person to have to deal with. However, did I panic? No, I went about solving the problems in a systematic engineering manner. The teacher asked if I wanted to work with all kids at once. I politely declined (you know what herding cats is like, right?) and decided to work with one class at a time for half a day each. This ended up working fairly well, and on the second day I worked with everyone at once, using what battery life we had left to work in groups of five or six.

Now, I am about to begin a rant about not having electricity, I apologize in advance.
<strong>Problem 1</strong>: The town of Pallac has electric lines installed, however, they donât work.  The state screwed that one up.
<strong>Problem 2</strong>: There is no alternative charging system. No solar panels, no generator, no hand crank, no bike crank, nothing.
<strong>Problem 3</strong>: The closest town with electricity is a 5 hour round trip walk.
<strong>Problem 4</strong>: The teachers didnât know that they could take the batteries, because they are all the same, and charge them in one or two laptops back at their homes in the cities. This meant, that the laptops were not getting charged, unless kids went to the closest town to charge their laptops.
<strong>Problem 5</strong>: Only being able to charge a laptop once a week, means the kids only use it once a week, meaning they never have the chance to play with and explore the system.
So, a culmination of issues has created a situation where kids want to learn, but canât. Who, for the love of god, didnât research this before distributing the laptops. Seriously, the hardest part of getting the kids the laptops is done. Itâs absolutely ridiculous.

Update - I wrote the Ministry of Education about this, I got a one line response - "We'll look for a solution" translation "Blah, Blah, Blah we won't do anything". Sorry if I sound bitter, but this pisses me off.

		<title>Oct 26 - Only 20 minutes to Upacoto. LIES!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night was my first time sleeping on a bed made of hay. I have to say that it was actually quite comfortable and I wouldnât mind doing it again. I was ready pretty early, because the janitor had shown up early to sweep and clean the school. This is actually kind of a funny idea, considering that when he sweeps the rooms, it really kicks up more dust than anything, which leaves everything coated in dust and the room unbreathable for about 20 minutes.

For the first half of the day I taught the younger kids and did a school-wide workshop after recess. We worked until our batteries were gone.

<em>Pallac</em></p>
I was fed a really good beef soup and lomo saltado (beef with tomatoes, rice, and French fries). One of the teacherâs husbands made it and it was honestly the best soup and lomo Iâve had while in Peru. After lunch I left the school with the teacherâs husband to walk to the town across the canyon, where his motorcycle was parked. He would be giving me a ride to a town somewhat close to where I needed to go. Once we got to Pache, about an 45min walk, we found that a engineer was leaving in a car. I was able to bum a ride with him to the top of the mountain. From the top of the mountain I began walking. I had to walk to Puma (the town has this name for a reason, the area is full of Pumas) and then down to Upacoto.

Before I continue, I must include an interesting conversation that I had with the teacherâs husband. Apparently the teacher who sold me the bus ticket the past Friday, the one who said that bad people live in Pallac and they would rob me, was also the same teacher that got removed from hitting her students. And then, when confronted by parents, hitting them too. So apparently, she wasnât entirely truthful about the people being bad. Like the teacherâs husband said, âIf you are open to the people here, they are open to you. If not, then they wonât beâ. I think that this is true everywhere, if only we had the community mentality to deal with the problems like the people of Pallac do.

The walk to Puma was relatively easy. It was all on a road that was mostly flat. It took me a little over an hour.  When I got to Puma, I got directions to Upacoto, which pretty much consisted of âTake that pathâ. When I asked how long it would take, they said 20mins. This was a lie. I began walking on the path, which quickly turned into something even a goat would have trouble with. The path soon disappeared and I was stuck sliding down a hill on my feet as I made my way towards Upacoto. Eventually, and after about an hour of hill sliding, I was at a point where I could cross the stream/canyon barrier and begin to quickly make my way to Upacoto. The overall trek took about two hours from Puma to Upacoto. Not exactly the 20mins I had been promised.  It was one of the most difficult walks Iâve done so far, although the hike up from Huanlla to Pampas Grande still takes the cake. For full effect, you should watch the video (coming soon).

I arrived at the school, where the teacher was pleasantly surprised to see me. She politely informed me I was a week early. Well I showed her by pulling out my schedule, and the schedule won! Okay, so it wasnât quite that dramatic, but she was a bit surprised. Nevertheless, she turned out to be one of the nicest teacherâs Iâve met and we moved past this hurdle without a problem. She was even nice enough to give me her room, and she went to stay with one of the parents. Super, super nice. I talked to a bunch of the parents, fielding the usual questions, and then got some dinner. I was so exhausted from my walk, that I promptly passed out after dinner because I was so exhausted. Oh, and for those of you worrying if I was sweaty and dirty, yes, I was. BUT, I rinsed myself in the sink before dinner so that I was a bit more presentable.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was woken up by what sounded like robbers at 530am. I stumbled out into the courtyard of the school to find two students cleaning the school house. I think I scared them as much as they scared me. We exchanged brief hellos, and then they got back to work. Since I was up so early, I went stick hunting. After having slid down the hill yesterday, I promised myself that I would build myself a walking stick that even Gandalf would be jealous of (LOTR reference anyone?). So I hiked up the hill behind the school a bit and soon found a suitable candidate. There a literally hundreds of stick lying around from all the cut down eucalyptus trees, that are used for firewood when it isnât raining. Eucalyptus makes a fairly good walking stick because the bark comes off quite easily. I spent a good hour working on the stick until a parent showed up to take me to breakfast.

I followed the parent the 5 minute walk to his house (along a goat path on the side of a hill of course) and was soon gorging myself on rice and potatoes, nodding and smiling the whole time to let the parents know how delicious it was. Of course, inside, I was dying a bit wishing I could get a sausage and some proper hash browns. BUT, when people who are extremely poor feed you food, you eat it, you love it, and you tell them every minute how good it is. After breakfast, it was back to the school for the morning lesson.

Since Upacoto also does not have electricity, I quickly decided that the eight students would work in pairs with the screen brightness turned all the way down.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Working in pairs by Jpatzer, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5125489705/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1169/5125489705_aed033f9b8_z.jpg" alt="Working in pairs" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Working in Pairs</em></p>
The XO has a pretty neat feature that allows the screen to turn into a black/white screen much like the amazon kindle. This really helps to save battery life. We were able to breeze through a bunch of things before recess. I was working at breakneck speed because I knew that battery life was my enemy. But the kids took it in stride and soaked up everything like sponges. During recess I finished off my walking stick, giving it a sharp point on the top, in case I had to fight any Pumas (or people who took a liking to my bags).

After recess, we breezed through more things and before we knew it, the day was over (at 1pm). I grabbed some lunch with a kid and soon found myself sitting by the creek in the sun reading my book. I spent most of the afternoon here relaxing. Very enjoyable. I spent a couple of hours photographing about four of the students while they played. By darkfall, I had hundreds of photos. The kids were so photogenic I just couldnât stop myself. Eventually I was led to dinner, where once again I gorged on rice and, wait for it, potatoes. After dinner I meandered back to my room, finished my book and went to sleep around 8pm. Itâs hard to stay awake, when you have no electricity to work on your laptop.

		<title>Oct 28 - Lots of walking = smelly shoes!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was woken up again at 530am the robber cleaners. I cleaned up, took some photos of the sunrise, and was ready to go when school started.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Painty clouds by Jpatzer, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5125992550/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1174/5125992550_7632945b65_z.jpg" alt="Painty clouds" width="557" height="640" /></a>
<em>Sunrise</em></p>
I anticipated that we would only have battery sufficient for about 2.5 hours at most, so I told the teacher I planned on leaving around recess. She agreed, mostly because walking to Cochabamba, where I could hopefully find a car would probably take about 2.5 hours. For the morning session, I did a review with the kids and then was able to cover some new topics. I felt that I had to rush, but didnât have a choice. I think the kids got quite a bit out of the workshops and only wish they had electricity so that they could explore their laptops further.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Upacoto by Jpatzer, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5125989066/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1243/5125989066_2294812c84_z.jpg" alt="Upacoto" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>The class of Upacoto</em></p>
When recess showed up, I suited up â big backpack on back, small backpack on front, and now walking stick in hand â and was off. I was accompanied by three of the older students who were to serve as my guides. Since they were about half my size, I felt like Gandalf and they were the hobbits. I didnât try to convey this, it would not have translated well I think. They walked with me for a little over an hour to the top of the ridge, where they pointed out how to get down to the town. As a parting gesture the oldest one asked to be paid. I laughed and told them that they could have candy but that I would not give them money. After this, it was mostly downhill (which starts to hurt oneâs feet after a while) until the town. I got to town at about 1245, but unfortunately there was no car. Soooo, I kept walking down the slope to get to Pariacoto. After about an hour or so, a car happened to come by. Luckily, it was filled with teachers who knew me, and I was able to pile into the trunk area. After about 15 minutes (which would have been probably another 1.5hour walk) we were in Pariacoto. I am lucky a car came by, not because I was tired, but because my feet were starting to hurt. After walking downhill for so long, they felt completely pounded. I think I might have lost about an inch in height during the day, not a good thing for me!

I got lunch with the teachers and then we waited for another couple of hours for the bus. Eventually the bus showed up, we fought for seats (Peruvian buses are not for the faint of heart, or poor old ladies), and by 5pm were on our way back to Huaraz. We got back to Huaraz around 830pm and I made my way to the hotel. At the hotel, they told me they were full, and to come back the next day. The owner has another hotel that he recommended going to, but since Hope and Josh had already been there and described how much is SUCKED, I decided to go to our back-up hotel, the hotel Las Vegas (reminds me of RaÃºl, a friend in LV doing TFA). While the hotel Las Vegas has much faster internet, it is also close to the market which makes it a bit louder. However, this didnât bug me much in comparison to my shoe smell. Imagine shoes that are dusty and sweaty and donât get changed for weeks, do you feel your nose wrinkling? Well, my did when I took them off my feet, so I got some incense to burn to combat the smell. It worked surprising well and Iâll make sure to get some talc powder for my shoes to help combat the smell further.

The funny thing about being away from the internet for a few days, is when you get it back, youâre like an addict. You stay glued to it for hours, doing nothing but getting plugged back in. Well, I was up late on the intertubes and fell asleep disappointed I did not have more energy to keep going. Overall, a long, very trying week, but satisfying. Everything one could hope for from such an adventure.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we rolled into Lima around 6am. Our bus stopped at their bus terminal, and we clambered off grabbing our stuff. Then the bus left, which we thought was odd. We were soon attacked by a mob of taxi drivers. We inquired about prices, and they quoted us a huge and large sum. We laughed at them, but then they informed us that we were in old lima, north of the city, rather than in the middle of the city, at the other bus terminal. This was a surprise, since no workers on the bus mentioned that there were two terminals. Anyways, instead we got a cheap ride to the "subway", which is really a dedicated bus lane that moves pretty quick. We were able to bus down to where our hostal is located, and then walked from the station to the hostal.

We ended up picking a hostal named HQ Villa, which was a great decision. This place is literally a villa with comfy couches and a great breakfast! Only about 7$ a day too, when sleeping in the dorms. We ate some breakfast and got ready for our day. I had been in contact with some local LimeÃ±os via a service (website) called CouchSurfers. We decided to meet up and soon enough we found ourselves in the back of their car getting a private tour of the city. We grabbed lunch at a arabic restaurant, which was a smart and tasty decision. After lunch, our guests took us back to their house where we chatted for a few hours. It was really interesting to see how more well-off Peruvians live, considering most of our time is spent with the other side of the social class. This is very different from the ways that they live, the fun they have, and their opinions that they have on their country.

<em>Hope+Josh</em></p>
We were eventually dropped off back near our hostal, where we met up with some friends to watch the world series. The two girls I speak of, were ones we met when we were first in Lima. They are both doing Fullbright scholarships/projects. It was great to catch up, eat a nice steak, and watch some baseball. We met at TGI Fridays, so it was a nice reminder of home. The workers at Fridays were decked out in some serious Halloween garb, which was cool to see. The bartender could do some pretty cool tricks too, which kept us entertained.

After dinner, we got some churros, which they fill with different fillings here. For instance, vanilla or manjar blanco. This makes them quite tasty and also super sweet. However, every once in a while won't hurt you. We got back to our Hostal around 10pm where we spent some time on the internet, and since our bus ride the night before had meant we hadn't slept that well, were in bed by 12pm. Overall, a long and enjoyable day. It was just the type of thing we need to give us a break from our normal routine.

I'd like to specially thank Ana and her friend Jesse for taking us around and showing us a great time. We are really thankful for all the time you spent with us!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week really began on Monday night. Hosh and myself had arrived back in Huaraz around 6am in the morning. We trudged our way to the hotel, and all took a nap until about 10am. While the bus trip from Lima is advertised as a âbuss camaâ or bed bus, sleeping is minimal at best in my experience. We spent the rest of the day relaxing and working. Around 6pm, I met the teacher with whom I would be traveling and we piled into a combi for the three hour ride to Cajamarquilla. I would be working at the same place all week, since the places I was scheduled to visit were too distant and would have had to walk for too long a period of time (not that that is really much of an issue anymore). Now this particular combi trip was exceptional in that it had to be the MOST CROWDED combi I have ever been on. They should only be able to hold about 14 people, we had 22. In addition, the roof was piled up about 3 feet high with cargo, and the entire inside walkways were filled with bags. Honestly, I could not move an inch. Throw in the fact that the seats have about no padding, which means you are riding on metal bars, and you have a recipe for a very uncomfortable three hours spent on small dirt mountain roads.

Nevertheless, we arrived in Cajamarquilla without a hiccup, thank god, and I was shown to my room. I promptly passed out. I awoke Tuesday morning feeling like someone had kicked me in the stomach. I had a terrible case of bubble guts that would only get worse throughout the day. I rallied, got ready for the day, and by 630am was walking with the teacher up to the school, located in Shipash Huain, a 45 minute walk uphill. By the time we got to the school, of course I had worked up a good sweat in addition to my stomach that would not stop talking. Seriously, it was making noises. I suffered through breakfast, not because the food was bad, but because I had almost no appetite and any bit of food that hit my stomach felt like the equivalent of getting punched. After breakfast, I worked with the kids until 1pm in a couple different activities. The students themselves were typical of most I had encountered. Some were quick to learn while others needed much more help. Usually the ones that understand help the others, which is helpful to me since I work alone. However, the biggest problem with this is that the students who need the help, tend to just become reliant on the help and wait for it, rather than taking initiative. While normally I would not permit this, my time is limited, and I have to make compromises.

During recess, their ball got stuck on the roof of one of the buildings. To get the ball down, and here-in lies the difference between the US and here, we used a piece-mealed ladder propped up on chairs to give it more height. One girl climbed up onto the tin roof, which is not the most structurally safe structure I have ever seen, and grabbed the ball. Never, ever, in a million years, would a kid be permitted to do such a thing in the States. Not only because itâs dangerous, that can be overlooked, but because someoneâs lawyer will sue if anything happens. However, if you have only one ball and you live in a place where the only law is that which the community enforces, then it just doesnât really matter.

We had a quick break for lunch. The teacher made a large amount of food, which I was only able to eat half of before I wanted to curl into a ball and cry like a little girl as my stomach did circles like a washing machine. She understood though, and knew that it didnât have to do with my dislike of the food. In fact, I was eating better than I had in weeks. We had chicken and vegetables. Of course it makes sense then, that when I get good food, I donât feel like eating. Typical. We finished up around 430pm, and made the trek back to Cajamarquilla. As soon as we arrived I passed out in my room. I woke for dinner, where I only drank some tea, and then immediately went back to sleep. My sleep was periodically interrupted by the need to use the bathroom (itâs what you think it was, although probably worse), but by the time I woke up the next day at 530am, I felt like a new man. My stomach had stopped hurting and everything felt back to normal. I can only speculate what the cause of this temporary sickness was, but I think it was a combination of altitude (we were at about 3800meters, Lima is 0meters) and the large amount of red meat I had had in Lima. Oh well, all part of the adventure.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I woke up feeling amazing, in comparison to yesterday. The 630am walk to school felt like a skip in the park. Well kind of, it was still 45 minutes up a 5-30% grade (it fluctuates, for pity assume itâs always higher :P ). The day flew by in a relatively quick blur. We worked on a variety of different activities and before I knew it we were on our way back to town. Nothing out of the ordinary occurred, except that the teacherâs propane tank ran out of gas. What this meant is two things, one of the studentâs mothers made us lunch and I got to carry down an empty gas tank back to town. While they arenât too heavy, 45 minutes of a metal tank bouncing on my shoulders is not the most enjoyable experience. But, did I complain? No, I took it like a champ, telling every Peruvian I asked that it was light and easy to carry. This of course impresses them and will lead to legendary stories about my strength.

Once back in town I helped the teacher along with a friend of hers, move into a different room. This was a somewhat uneventful process, until she decided to light a fire to burn some old papers and pieces of plastic, in the room. While I love a good fire, it tends to be better to do this outdoors, in a fire pit, rather than on the concrete floor in a confined space where your only hope of not passing out is to crouch down. Add in a bit of burning plastic, and why youâve got a room full of smoke and carcinogens. Needless to say, if I knew her better I would have some choice words to throw in her direction for this brilliant decision. However, being the gentleman I am, I settle for the witty sarcasm of âSheâs trying to kill us!â, while it doesnât have the same ring as âWhat the f&amp;*k are you doing?!â, I think I got my point across. After this, we had some dinner and I returned to my room to go to sleep, somewhat more lightheaded than before the fire.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up at 530am as usual and by 630am was bounding my way to school (imagine Bambi). Since we didnât have anything to cook breakfast with, we ate an onion/tuna salad with soda crackers. While this doesnât sound that good, it was similar to a tuna sandwich, until the crackers ran out.

With the kids, I finished up making a game in scratch (originally designed by Josh, nice job Josh). We only worked until 1145am since we had to be back in Cajamarquilla for the 1pm combi back to Huaraz. However, since I had already been at the school for two days, and normally I only have about 2 or 1.5 days, I felt like I had all the time in the world. We were able to get through a lot of stuff, but more importantly, the teacher was a somewhat young lady and was interested in knowing more. Since she knew how to use the internet, I gave her a list of sites to visit as well as instruction to search google for more ideas. Hopefully she follows through.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Teacher becomes the student by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5148333279/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5148333279_a4f3c64fe4_z.jpg" alt="Teacher becomes the student" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Teacher working with her students</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Shipash Huain by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5148314569/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/5148314569_5056aee42d_z.jpg" alt="Shipash Huain" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>The students of Shipash Huain</em></p>
The combi left around 130pm, rather than the 1pm time originally intended. I listened to my iPod most of the way, mostly just to drown out the Huaino (not sure of the spelling here, but pronounced Wino), music that continually blares from the radios here. Itâs terrible and makes me want to kill people. One of the teachers riding back with us to Huaraz told me he had some trouble with a USB stick of his. We agreed to meet later that night so that I could help him troubleshoot. It turned out that his issue was solved with a simple formatting because the drive had become corrupted. He was incredulous and couldnât believe that it was now working. I told him that it must be because I was good luck, but this was only because I couldnât communicate the idea that I had magic powers. That would have been more epic. Sigh.

The rest of the night was spent at dinner and on the internet. Of course, after being away for a few days, I needed my fix! While this week was not full of walking, my stomach ordeal and nearly passing out due to inhalation of plastic fumes, kept things plenty interesting.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Are laptops the most important thing?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many of the villages that I have been visiting live with the most basic of needs. The rarely have running water in the small aqueduct systems. They eat potatoes and rice for every meal, usually accompanied by soup and cafesito (boiled black water with sugar). They eat off the floor or their laps. They rarely shower or bathe. Washing oneâs hand is rare and fingernails are always dirty. Dust permeates everything and the smell of farm animals clings to the people. The houses are made of adobe bricks with perhaps one light bulb in a building. Due to these harsh and most basic of conditions, medical care is basic and extremely limited.

When one is sick, your remedy is often eucalyptus tree-leaf tea or any other combination of herb water. While these sometimes help with the occasional stomach ache, they do not help with other diseases or ailments. Many of the kids suffer from serious bouts of warts. The warts cover the hands, often numbering upwards of 15 on a single hand, and with sizes sometimes approaching a dime. There are no cures for this. They cannot burn them off with super-cold liquid nitrogen. They cannot sear them off with a heat gun. All they can do is permit the warts to grow and spread without check.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Warts by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5151291451/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/5151291451_6e9bb64094_z.jpg" alt="Warts" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Warts by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5151287949/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/5151287949_23c687e317_z.jpg" alt="Warts" width="425" height="640" /></a></p>
Besides warts, the other most prominent ailment is frostbite on the kidâs hands and faces. This will create hands covered in scabs and checks that are affected the same way. This give the kids rosy cheeks, while in reality they are really just scabs. Combine this with dirt and you have some very unhealthy looking skin.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Caused by Cold by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5151896100/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5151896100_3808b0f2f6_z.jpg" alt="Caused by Cold" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
The last thing that affects the kids is diarrhea. They drink the water from the tap and the streams, which are contaminated with animal feces. This results in making the kids sick to the stomach. While they confess to being used to the water, this is only partly true.  It is never possible to be completely used to contaminated water.

These three things are only a few of the many medical issues that plague the communities. While they are a big problem, sometimes I have to wonder if teaching kids to use laptops might not be the most pressing matter when they suffer from other physical ailments.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The kids in the schools do not eat very much food. This is not to say that they are not hungry, merely that they do not have a large amount of food to eat. The school day itself is limited by this fact. School typically lasts from 8am to 1pm. Sometimes kids will return in the afternoon for a couple hours, but this is dependent on the teacher, school, and geography (whether or not travel is easy enough to return). The kids will have a small breakfast at home that at most consists of a few potatoes and some Arina (what to me seems like the liquid part of oatmeal). They then arrive at school and will get a small snack at lunchtime. This will consist of government provided bread known as papapan (father bread) and some fortified white liquid drink prepared by one of the mothers of the students (the powder to make the liquid is also provided by the government). They call this liquid leche or milk, however it taste more like liquid dough. While neither of these things is a tasty endeavor, the kids inhale all of it quickly because they are starving. Both of these items are provided by the government, because if the kids did not have this snack, they would not eat anything until dinner time. <object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QhMFNQhVUhA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QhMFNQhVUhA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

		<title>Nov 8 - Another hike to the last place in the &quot;Campo&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, although I did not have to be up early, I was awake by 6am due to some blaring music coming from another room. I roused myself and began packing. The teacher came to the hotel around 9am so that we could head to the bus. We made a few errand stops on the way, and were at the bus stop by 930am. The bus was due to leave at 10am, it was out of the gate early at 1030am. What amazed me most about this is not that the bus was late, but that I have become accustomed to it. It doesnât really faze me anymore. However, this might be due to the knowledge that whether or not the bus leaves on time, I still have to sit on it for about 3 hours (or more). Whatâs the rush? Wait here, wait there.

For Monday and Tuesday I would be working at a town called Coltus. On the map given to me by the specialist, this was the one furthest away. While the bus ride wasnât the longest, that was the one to Pampas Grande (6 hours), our 3 hour bus ride was not short by any means. When we arrived at the point we needed to disembark, we still had another 2 hours of walking ahead of us. Our trek took us up the mountain side (35 mins to about 4300meters), across the plains along the top of the hills (90 mins), and back down the other side (45 mins to about 3800meters). Luckily it was quite a nice day, and although brisk, the walk itself was not too difficult. Time passed somewhat quickly as I talked to the teacher about his previous job as a Guide in the area. Out of curiosity, I asked which tourists were the worst, without hesitation he replied Israelis. That was the same thing the mountain bike guide said. A pattern perhaps?

During our descent to the village, itâs really only a gather of mud houses, I noticed one important thing: no power lines. The first thought that went through my head was, again? However, when I asked the teacher about the power situation, he informed me that they had a solar system. Awesome! I asked how he got it, thinking that maybe the government had gotten their job right. He replied that some random group of 3 volunteers from the University of Michigan showed up about 7 months prior to deliver a system. They came on their own and the government had, and still does not have, any knowledge that they were coming. Random huh? Well luckily, that means we can charge laptops. I asked what the teacher did before this and he told me that he would carry about half the batteries, but only half, because they were heavy. This meant the laptops could only be used for at most one day, now they can be used every day. Props to the people of Michigan, well done guys!

After we rested a bit and had a snack, it was beginning to get dark. This was also accompanied by the loss of all warmth as it became very cold, due to the altitude is my guess. This did not deter the villagers, since apparently, they gather to watch movies most nights in the school. One of the parents has a generator with which to power the TV and DVD player. We ended up watching âClash of the Titans,â which in my opinion is a weird situation. Here I am, in rural Peru, with people who have probably never heard of Greece, watching a Greek myth. I think the story was somewhat lost on them. Either way, the original version is definitely better than the new one that came out recently, so if youâre going to watch Perseus kill Medusa, watch the original. After the movie I set up my bed of sheep skins on the floor of one of the school rooms, crawled into my sleeping bag and passed out. While this may sound somewhat dirty, and it is, it is also super warm, so I cannot complain.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I woke up this morning around 530am, because well thatâs when the sun comes out. It was difficult to force myself out of my warm sleeping bag (on top of the sheep skins) as it was bitterly cold. It was cold enough that I did not bother washing my face or hair, because that would have meant putting water on my face and losing any warmth I had. I settled for wearing my hat all day.

After breakfast, the school day began. The teacher taught the kids for the first 1.5hours and after this I took over until the end of the day. Beyond the normal workshops I normally run, nothing was too out of the ordinary. Except, for the fact that every time we ate food throughout the day, I had to go and use the bathroom immediately afterwards (it wasnât pretty so Iâve omitted details, youâre welcome).  The other thing that was a bit odd was our recess snack, which consisted of anchovies, potatoes, and rice. It actually wasnât that bad, and hey, it was protein.

<em>Working in Pairs</em></p>
After school, one of the mother delivered lunch which was the standard rice and potatoes. I chatted with the teacher for a bit, took a stroll up the hill to get a look around, and generally killed time until it got dark. Along with the loss of light, also went any warmth as it cooled down to a brisk 2 degrees Celsius (only to get colder as the night wore on). At night, once again we watched a movie. We actually had a double feature. While this sounds amazing let me explain that all the movies they buy are illegal copies, bad illegal copies. Skipping, fuzzy pictures, bad audio, and all sorts of other things plague the DVDs. However, the DVD quality was overshadowed by the movie choices for the evening.

Our first feature was a Peruvian film centering on life in the countryside, when a village is attacked by a brain eating zombie. Disregarding the terrible film quality (acting, sound, lighting, pretty much everything), the story itself was just ridiculous. It centers on a village not unlike the one I am in that is attacked by a zombie that spits on you to mesmerize you, then eats the back of your head. Of course all was going well, until the towns people caught him and beat the crap of him. The zombie got a few people though before they took him out. The kids were scared, and I think so were the adults, although they might have been trying to hide it.

After Peruvian zombie movie, to lighten the mood, we watched a Samson and Hercules movie from the 60âs where the two legends take on some sort of kingdom. The special effects were hokey and the acting terrible, and once again I had to wonder how much of the story was lost on the people. I mean, how are they supposed to know that Hercules and Samson are mythic figures with tremendous strength? I think that the people merely assumed they were supposed to be really strong guys, but they enjoyed it and laughed anyways.

After the movies, I once again returned to my sheep skin bed to pass out. However the night would not pass silently, as a decent earthquake shook the building around 130am in the morning. It was strong enough that I woke up before it fully hit, was thoroughly concerned while it was shaking a mud brick school house (which I was sleeping in), and small enough that it only lasted about 15 seconds. Upon not getting pulled out of bed by the teacher, I assumed it was safe to go back to sleep. And that is what I did, I went back to sleep.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was a fairly standard day. The teacher did a lesson with the kids in the early part of the morning and handed over the class around 930am. We had enough time to build a game using Scratch. It took the majority of the day. After school ended around 1pm the teacher and I got lunch with one of the families. After lunch he held more class for a couple of the grades. He does this every day. Since he teaches a 22 kid, multi-grade class, he has parts of the class return after lunch to work with them more exclusively. The teacher was a great guy and his approach made a big difference with the students.

During this time, I spent it reading, walking around the area (it wasnât that big), and waiting for it to get cold. Fortunately, it didnât get as cold as the day before. After dinner we turned in early because I had to get up at 245am to leave and hike to the road where I could catch a car back to Huaraz the next morning.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I was up very early, 245am to be exact. I was ready with my things by 315am and had woken up the kid who would be walking with me to the road by 330am (he was my guide because it was dark and I only knew the general direction I was to be going). The reason I was up this early was because I need to hike to the road in order to catch the 530am combi that would take me back to Huaraz. The walk was for the most part in the âlevelâ, which means there was no hiking up a hill. The poor kid walking with me was 12 years old and was definitely lagging at points. I gave him some energy bars and his pace picked up immediately. It also didnât help that it wasnât particularly warm. Either way we got to the road after about 1.75 hours and the combi came soon after. I gave the kid the rest of the food that I had so he could eat something before having to walk back.

The ride back in the combi took about 3 hours. I would have tried sleeping, but the driver was a maniac. Literally, a maniac. Now, but this point, Iâve gotten used to people driving fast on dirt mountain roads, but this guy was something else. Curve coming up? No worries, speed into it! Car to pass? No worries, drive faster and swerve while clenching your knuckles. Itâs a wonder I didnât crap myself at certain points. It probably helped that I was tired and half out of it :/. Either way, we did get back to Huaraz and I made a beeline for a cafÃ© to eat breakfast. I ended up staying at the cafÃ© for most of the day catching up on internet. I eventually meandered over to the hotel, took a shower, and went to sleep in a bed not made of sheep skins, which while not as warm did smell a bit better!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hope originally wrote a version of her experience as an OLPC intern, which I <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2010/10/29/guest-post-by-hope-and-josh/" target="_self">reproduced on my site</a>.

Iâm jolted awake this morning by my cell phone ringing, it the cheapest Chinese model I could buy and the ringtone is equally as cheap. I think it is only my alarm so I am slow to get it. However as I blearily stare at the phone, searching for the button to cease the terrible sound (the ringer) from interrupting what had been great sleep, I see that it is actually a call. I answer the phone âHola?â On the other end I am asked if this is âSeÃ±or Jeffreyâ, I reply that yes it is, and soon the other person explains that he is the teacher of Tinyash and âAm I supposed to be going with him today to his school?â I reply that I am. He then asks me, âHow do you normally get to the schools, by car or walking?â I think back to my hike the morning before and quickly answer, âWalking,â I answer emphatically. This question does not strike me odd at the moment. We agree to meet in 45 minutes, or at least I think that is what he said. Sometimes I am not sure, talking on the phone in another language is always a challenge. This call is a bit of a surprise, because I had not heard from this teacher the day before about whether or not I would be going with him. As a result I had not really planned for it and had been up a bit later than a 6am wake-up call makes comfortable. This thought passes through my mind in an instant, only to be removed because I am soon throwing things into my bag at breakneck speed. As I put the XO into my backpack I lament not having charged it the night before. The battery is essentially dead because the last school I was at had no electricity, but I figure I can charge it at the school.

I donât have time for breakfast because I opt to wash my face. I rush to the Combi station without anything in my stomach. The only thing I know at this moment is that the school I am supposed to be going to is close to Huaraz. The teacher and I meet up; heâs a genial, young looking fellow in good shape. We jump in a Combi and are soon speeding out of town at breakneck speed, which is also the only speed Combis know how to drive at. I am sitting in the seat closest to the door. This turns out to be a terrible mistake as I soon find out. Combis routinely stop to pick up more passengers waiting on the side of the road, and each time we stop I get stepped over receiving the business end of somebodyâs rear-end. Luckily the Combi is soon full and it makes no more stops. The teacher and I are let off after only about 15 minutes in the Combi, probably an all time low for me, and I am relieved to see the town right next to the road. I think to myself, Awesome, no walking! As I begin trotting towards the town, the teacher grabs my attention and motions that we are to walk in the other direction. Iâm not yet worried.

We cross the river that runs through the valley over and as I step over the saggy, old, creaky, wood boards that are also as holey as Swiss cheese,  my heart rate increases a bit. Only seeing a massive hill in front of me, I ask the teacher, his name is Jony as I have found out by this point, where are we going or âAdonde vamos?â He points to the top of the hill and says âA la punta, arrrrrriiiiiibbbbaâ (they lengthen a word to increase the emphasis) or translated, âTo the top, waaaayyyyy up thereâ. I think, âF*&amp;k!â Then, as if knowing this isnât enough, I query âHow long will it take to walk there?â Jony cruelly chuckles and tells me that it will take 1.5 hours, but weâre going the fast way, so it will only take an hour. I think âDouble F*&amp;k! But how kind of him to take the fast route.â The question of whether or not I walk to schools comes flashing back to my mind. Ah hah, so that is why he asked me that.

We begin ascending which at best could be called a path but is more aptly described as something a mountain goat would be at home walking on. I lift one foot in front of the other and within 5 minutes I am huffing and puffing. This could be due to the altitude of 3100meters, or it could be due to the vertical face we are scaling. To help myself with the walk, I focus on the ground in front of me and try not to look at the massive hill in front of me. After about 30 minutes weâve reached a town called San Juan. We get a short reprieve as the ground levels out. However, I then look up and see that we still have even more hill to scale. I sigh in resignation, ignore the hunger in my stomach, tighten my shoes and pack, and keep trudging on.

The walk soon turns back into a goat path and I realize that the short path we are taking should not be described as shorter, but steeper. Jony and I get to chatting and he tells me he does this every day. He says sometimes his knees hurt. Really? I wonder why that is. I tell him he should buy trekking poles, 25$ in the market, to help him scale the hill. He thinks this is a good idea and wonders why he did not think of it in the prior 3 years that he had been working here. I think the same thing. As our hike continues on, my lungs begin to burn like a hot iron. The air is so thin, my legs do not have the time to get tired before my lungs run out of air. Jony is understanding of my feeble conditioning (and I consider myself in decent shape) and we stop periodically so I can recover my vision. Our journey continues on for some time, I have stopped thinking about when it will be over and only concentrate on the five feet in front of me. I do this to both to steel myself from giving up and also because my vision blurs from oxygen deprivation past this distance.

After about 1.25 hours, we reach the school. We have probably ascended about 1100 meters and my shirt has become completely soaked. I lament my decision of wearing the only clean clothes I had left. I now realize that the description âclose to Huarazâ had been somewhat of a lie. Yes, the ride in the combi was close and quick, but the walk turned into a cruel test of endurance. I tear my shirt off and replace it with my jacket, placing the shirt on a set of rocks to dry. The only food I have with me is peanut butter, so I eat a couple scoops since I find out none of the parents are bringing us breakfast. This helps to calm the talking that my stomach is doing in protest of not having anything in it. I push the hunger out of my mind by ignoring it.

Jony tries to switch the lights to the school on and finds that nothing happens. Apparently, there had not been any electricity for the last couple of days in the town. There are a few thoughts that go through my mind at this point, and it is worth relating them: âWish I had charged my XO the night before,â âI hope the kids have charged laptops,â âWeâll work in pairs and turn the screen brightness down to prolong battery life,â âIâm only here for a day and itâs the day they have no electricity, haha,â and what I think is the most important âAre you f*&amp;king serious!?â Nevertheless, I take this set-back in stride and group the kids into pairs and have them turn down the brightness of the screens. We have only 3 laptops with charged batteries for 7 students, I pray it will be long enough for the day.

We launch into the workshops, the same ones I do with almost every school, and are soon copying text and photos from the Wikipedia activity and pasting them into the Writing activity. I have yet to encounter any school that really knows how to use the clipboard, and Tinyash is no exception. I always have them copy the picture of Machu Pichu and the text surrounding it from the Peru article and then to reiterate the lesson we copy the picture of people playing soccer and the text surrounding it from the Futbol article. The students always like these articles, plus I know what is in them. After this workshop we move on to the Memory activity. This activity allows us to play a card matching game for addition, letters, and sounds, but most importantly we can create our own games. We create a game about animals with the animalâs name in Spanish and its English translation.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="What? by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5176432448/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5176432448_9115e878e4_z.jpg" alt="What?" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Creating their own game in Memorizar</em></p>
The students as I find out speak more Quecha, a local indigenous language, then they do Spanish and they shout names of animals in Quecha at me. I tell them I do not understand Quecha and to speak in Spanish. They remember this for about a minute and then relapse back to Quecha. It is a continual process of me reminding them and them relapsing.

Around 10am we break for recess and the kids rush out to play. I am always happy for this break as much as they are. The teacher and I trudge into another room of the school where we warm up milk to make hot chocolate to eat with the few bread rolls he has. I must interrupt the story at this point to describe Peruvian bread rolls or Pancito (little bread). It is a mixture of water and flour, more water than flour. It has no flavor and only slightly more substance. It is a staple for most Peruvians. They love it. I do not. Every time I eat one, only because I am hungry, I think longingly of German bakeries full of all types of bread and pastries. After our snack, Jony shows me around the school grounds. He shows me a room they have full of normal PC computers, which do not work because the building was built badly and as a result, when it rained it ruined the wiring in the floor. None of the computers can now work because they have no electricity, so they simply sit unused and gathering dust.

After my tour of the grounds we gather the kids back up and I launch into my next part of the workshops. After having created the memory game, we now share it through the mesh and play against each other.

<em>Playing Memorizar through the Mesh network</em></p>
I watch at these kids struggle with the idea of the game. They often click on the same cards over and over, hoping they will eventually match. I frustratingly explain over and over the idea of looking for pairs, however this does not seem to compute and they futilely continue their course of action. After playing the game for a bit we change tack and I begin to teach them the basics behind the Scratch activity.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Help by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5176436924/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5176436924_18194fac60_z.jpg" alt="Help" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Jony helping his students</em></p>
We make a simple project where the cat walks in circles meowing at the same time. They love listening to the cat meow. I make sure to add the sound last, because once it is there they continue to make the cat walk over and over, causing the meowing sound to play continually. I can only take so much of this before I want to throw the computers against the wall while laughing maniacally.

Once we have finished making this project it is almost the end of the day and only one computer has any battery left. I gather the kids around the last computer standing. The kid controlling the computer gives me attitude when I ask him to open the Browser activity. He thinks he is being funny as he says he does not know how. Thinking he is a smart little fellow, I switch to English and begin to say nothing in particular âIâm speaking to you in English, you donât understand me, it will make you uncomfortableâ¦â etc. His smile soon disappears from his face and as further punishment I give the laptop to another kid who will listen. Since I cannot discipline them, often times taking the laptop and speaking in English is the only recourse I have with unruly kids.

In the browser activity is a series of pictures of famous things from around the world. Things like the Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, and a Great White shark, to name a few. I like to show them the photos to help them think about other parts of the world. Soon though our time is up, which also coincides with the death of the last laptop.

<em>One of the students before I had to leave</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Hola by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5176419508/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/5176419508_ebd1cb929e_z.jpg" alt="Hola" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Same student, she loved the camera</em></p>
I change back into my original shirt for the walk back down the mountain. As I stare across the valley at the Cordillera Blanca, I see a mass of black clouds. I notice the wind is blowing into my face, which means the clouds are coming towards us. I think âGreat, now we get to hike down in the rain.â
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Rain on the horizon by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5176439624/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/5176439624_5443c5af6b_z.jpg" alt="Rain on the horizon" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Rain on the horizon</em></p>
Jony and I take off at breakneck speed, essentially running down the hill we had scaled earlier that morning. After about 10 minutes the rain begins in a medium downpour. Despite my jacket (which is supposed to be somewhat water proof), I am soon soaked to the skin. Slipping and sliding our way across rocks and mud on a 60% incline, we make the descent in only about 40 minutes. When we are finally at the road standing waiting for a Combi, my legs are quivering from the sprint down the hill, Iâm shivering from the rain, and as I look up at the sky, the rain stops. Seriously?

Within about 5 minutes weâve waived down a Combi and have piled in along with the 17 other people (in the 12 passenger vehicle) for the short ride back to Huaraz. Jony and I are seated in the front seats and as time wears on, the windshield becomes fogged up due to the moisture. The driver switches on his defroster which promptly accomplishes, nothing. So he takes to wiping his windshield with an old dirty rag, holding the wheel with one hand and wiping with the other. My life is completely out of my hands. He punctuates this wiping with handing change back to the people as they pay him, one hand wiping, one hand giving change, one hand driving. Do the math and it will all make sense.

We arrive back in Huaraz to be greeted by sunny skies. Jony and I chuckle at our luck, shake hands and part ways. The rest of the afternoon I occupy with a shower, eating, and recovering from my hike this morning. As I lay in bed at night, about to fall asleep and running over the dayâs events in my head, Jonyâs question about how I get to the schools flashes brightly in my mind, âHow do you normally get to the schools, by car or walking?â I smile wearily and think, I get there by walking. I get there by walking.
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008000;">I get there by walking.</span></h2>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I met the teacher with whom I would be traveling with around 730am. We took a short combi ride out of Huaraz into the foothills to the east. The ride was short and when we got off, the walk was equally as short. Essentially, I did not have to sweat, work, or try hard at all to get to my destination. I was absolutely baffled.

The school I visited had only three students, only two of which were old enough to have laptops. Another intern had visited the school during the summer, so the kids were what I considered advanced. However, my workshops were still applicable and I was able to teach them new things. I always want to make sure that what I am teaching is new, because it makes no sense for me to repeat myself. Unfortunately there is no electricity at the school and as a result we could only work until about 1230pm. After this the teacher and I walked the short distance back to the road, caught a Combi back to Huaraz, and I was back in the city by 145pm. Not bad considering my previous travel experiences.

Once back in town it was a relaxing afternoon, except the internet at the hotel did not work very well. As a result I couldnât get this post up sooner. Hope, Josh, and myself relaxed and did not do too much work. It was a good change of pace!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was my second to last day of actual OLPC work in the field. I met the Specialist at 8am at his office. He hadn't been able to get a hold of the teacher to the school which I would be going, so he was going to take me. However, due to a meeting we did not leave until 9am. We got to the school around 930am. Luckily it was not much of a walk (surprising again) and I arrived for once not sweaty.

The school itself was quite small with only about 10 students. Another intern from over the summer hadÂ actuallyÂ visited the school, but after investigating what he had taught, it turns out they did not really accomplish much beyond taking pictures and playing with the games. I dove right into Wikipedia and Escribir (writing activity) to practice copy and pasting text and photos. After this we created a Memorizar (Memory) game of spanish/english word translations. Based on the ability of the kids (more closely inability) to use the laptops, I have to seriously wonder what the interns over the summer were teaching the schools. Hope, Josh, and myself have heavily focused our efforts on making constructive workshops that explore the laptops educational facilities, not the games that come preloaded.

After the school day, we took the short Combi ride back to Huaraz and I grabbed lunch. Since it is my second to last day, I spent the afternoon packing. Hope, Josh, and myself will be heading to Trujillo tomorrow night for a few days of beach time!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was my last official day of field work for OLPC! While I still have a meeting on Monday to debrief with the ministry, the idea that I will not be traveling back out into the campo (country-side) and eating only rice and potatoes while not showering for long periods of time, does excite me.

As far as an experience today, it was a bit interesting. I was supposed to meet the teacher near the area where all the Combis leave from Huaraz to head in the direction I need to go, however the appointed time came and went and the teacher never showed up. Luckily I had run into the specialist on my walk over to the Combi area and had figured out the name of the bridge I was supposed to get off at. Armed with this knowledge, I jumped into the nearest combi and 15mins later found myself standing on the side of the road next to the Puente Mallaca. IÂ trudgedÂ the 10mins up the hill and when I got to the school, the teacher did not mention a thing about us missing ourÂ rendezvous. I decided to also not bring it up.

The teacher wanted to spend a lot of the day doing Grabar, essentially taking pictures and videos, but I am personally not fond of this activity. It is something that does not provide any real educational benefit to the kids (we can argue about this if you want) beyond a cool factor. In fact, most of the activities in the Peruvian XO image are not very useful, simply games, and often times are full of bugs. For this reason I have developed, along with the help of <a href="http://hopeandjosh.com/">Hope and Josh</a>, a series of <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/olpc-workshops/">workshops</a> that I believe fully take advantage of the best activities of the laptop, but also optimize educational opportunity. For many schools using the laptops isÂ synonymousÂ with game time. While this is not all bad, the educational aspect is getting completely overlooked. Rather I spent the day creating a game in Scratch with the kids.

Our day was somewhat interrupted though. I got through about half of the game by recess. However, during recess the kids decided they wanted to antagonize a dog and have it chase them around. While of course they all ended up getting nipped, one girl decided that it hurt a lot. <em>Now, before I proceed any further, I do feel bad when people get hurt, especially children, BUT if you are antagonizing an animal and get hurt as a result I have very, very little pity for you. </em>Her bite was no worse than a scrape, but she decided that she needed to cry, and have her friends carry her because she could no longer walk, for about two hours. Needless to say, this essentially ruined most of the afternoon time that would have been used to teach. Rather I spent the time leaning against the wall wanting to yell at the kids for antagonizing and animal and then complaining that it reacted. What really pissed me off though, had to the teacher's reaction. Instead of isolating the girl, and taking the attention away from her, which was the only reason she kept crying, he allowed it to continue and sent some students to go and get the mother. Essentially this immobilized the whole day. Even if I was not there to teach, this would have wasted an entire half of a school day for the students. After this, my respect for the teacher was almost non-existent. <em>Before you call me insensitive, remember that these kids play around rusty broken nails, sharp pieces of wood, cook meals over fires at recess, and a myraid of other extremely dangerous things that never phase them, but one dog bite and she deteriorates. I don't think I'm insensitive, I think I'm realistic. If you'd like to argue this point with me, don't hesitate to comment at the bottom of the page. </em>

Other than this, it started to rain when we needed to leave. The combi ride back to town was uneventful and when I got into the hotel my first mission was to dry off. As for the plans for the next few days, Hope, Josh, and myself will be traveling toÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trujillo,_Peru">Trujillo</a> for a few days of R&amp;R. We plan on visiting the beach first and foremost. After this we will head back to Lima for our meeting with the ministry. My girlfriend, Liz, will be flying down Monday night from San Francisco, and we will be spending the next few weeks (~4.5) traveling between Peru and Ecuador. Don't worry, I'll still be updating the blog! Just because my OLPC internship is over, doesn't mean the adventures will stop.

In the upcoming days I will have a post that will summarize my experience and provide an analysis of the OLPC program in Peru. Keep your eyes peeled, I plan on making it a good one :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A quick post, because I don't have much time. Last night we came from Huaraz to Trujillo. Got here super early, 7am. We are staying with a nice fellow via CouchSurfers. He spent the majority of the day showing us around the town. Tonight we're going out to see some of his friends. I'll write a longer more detailed post tomorrow when I have more time!

I'm having a great time, alive, and doing well. Also, starting soon, I'm going to start releasing a multi-part series on my experiences with OLPC and how the program is actually doing. Whether it is really making a difference or not. Stay on the lookout! Sorry I don't have an exact date, but I'm still working on it :/]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night we traveled from Huaraz to Trujillo via bus overnight. We arrive in Trujillo very early in the morning. To give a new type ofÂ accommodationÂ a try, we decided to try our luck out with a site known as <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/">CouchSurfing</a>. We met our host at the bus station and took a cab back to his place. He put us up on the room on the top of his house (literally its on the roof), which is actually awesome. We can see the entire city and we get to share the space with a Peruvian Hairless dog. The dog is a special breed specific to Peru and has to be one of the most ugly animals I've ever seen. His skin is very oily and soft, but you can't pet it because its very sensitive.Â He's quite friendly, but so ugly. You can't help but feel bad for him.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Peruvian Hairless by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5192697669/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5121/5192697669_000e2f116e_z.jpg" alt="Peruvian Hairless" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Peruvian Hairless</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Peruvian Hairless by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5193292918/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5193292918_7db88012ed_z.jpg" alt="Peruvian Hairless" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>No hair!</em></p>
After dropping off our things, our host walked us around the city center, which he lives close to. We stopped at a park for a bit to toss a Frisbee around for a break at one point. After seeing most of the beautiful architecture that makes up Trujillo, we decided to go out to the close-by beach, Huanchaco. The beach is a big destination for surfers and water enthusiasts. We took the 30 minute and 0.40$ bus out to the beach. We walked around the small town and got some ceviche and deep-fried fish for lunch. Being able to sit and enjoy the sun, wind, and smell of the ocean was a great change of pace from the Sierra that we had been living in for so long.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Peruvian Fishing Boats by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5192699425/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4086/5192699425_66e646f3d9_z.jpg" alt="Peruvian Fishing Boats" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Peruvian Fishing boats at Huanchaco</em></p>
After the beach, we went back to town and meandered off to find an internet cafe. We only had a short period of time before we had to meet up with some of our host's friends. We did some quick emails and before we knew it were in a taxi off to spend the night with some friends of his. We spent the rest of the night chatting and eventually made it to a salsa club where Hope finally fulfilled her desire of Salsa dancing. We were able to finally tuck in around 3am after a long and tourist filled day :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, Nov 21, was a day spent walking around Trujillo. We explored much of the central area, taking in the architecture and chatting with the various people that approached us. We even ventured to the modern mall they have just outside the main downtown area. This was like stepping into a time warp to the future. I did not realize how accustomed I had become to the bustling market areas filled with vendors, until we were walking around a clean, sterile mall with periodic consumerism announcements regarding sales. A real shock.

A night we met some more of Abraham's friends, but did not stay out too late. We had a bus to catch today that trucked us back to Lima. The ride was about 9 hours long and not too exciting. Much of the Peruvian countryside is a desert, which leaves much to be desired for scenery.

The hostal we choose though is close to the ministry, with whom we have a meeting tomorrow morning. We have to present about our experience and turn in all our reports. We hope it goes well, considering some of the things we have to say are a bit critical. However, after this presentation we will be officially done with the OLPC internship and will become full-time tourists!

		<title>Nov 22 - Wrapping up with the Ministry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was our last day as official OLPC interns. We were up early and out the door by 830am. We arrived at the ministry around 845am, got our badges (it only involved giving over our driver's licenses, pretty easy huh?), and were inside the compound within 10 minutes. We asked for our contact and were soon seated inside the same conference room in which we had been given our training.

We started off with the normal pleasantries and chit chat. We then launched into our prepared powerpointÂ presentation. We then spent the next 2.5 hours running through our experiences, a list of positives and negatives of the laptops, and finally recommendations to improve the overall program. Many of the negatives that we brought up were meant with excuses and explanations, or that they already knew they existed, either way by the end of the presentation they were not the most chipper. While we were tactful, we were also realistic. We told them the truth with the hope they would really want to change it. Either way, we got through the presentation and felt as if we had successfully communicated the challenges that face the ministry. We then went out to celebrate the end of our work with a hearty meal at a middle eastern restaurant. Hummus, yum!

After our return from lunch we had a discussion with our OLPC contact. We were able to recount our experience, again, and discuss the other aspects of the internship. It appears that OLPC is steering away from the on-the-ground type of internship and looking to implement more Graduate and PhD students who will perform observations and analysis. While this is a noble idea, it really doesn't help to train the teachers and aid the children. Rather it is more "solution-finding" than actually a solution, which is a real pity.

Tonight I will be picking up Liz from the airport, her flight arrives around midnight. I hope she will get through customs in under an hour. It will have been just about three months since we've seen each other, so it will be nice to be back together :)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we repacked all our bags, consolidating things down to the bare minimum. We then left about half of our stuff at a friends place in Lima. We were able to eat some lunch at an indian restaurant, which was quite delicious. Although not as delicious as Anu's mom's food. After lunch we grabbed our things and made our way to the bus terminal. We boarded a bus and headed down to Pisco (a town that shares the same name as the peruvianÂ liquor. We got to the town around 9pm, got a hotel, and then made arrangements to go to see the Islas Balestas tomorrow. It is called the "Poor Man's Galapagos".

The town of Pisco is a bit sad. It experienced a terrible earthquake in 2007 and is still rebuilding. Many things are still ruined and it adds a very somber note to the whole area.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nov 24 - Paracas Islands and on to Huacachina</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[**Pictures are to come, I haven't had enough time to go through them yet :)

Today we were all up early, around 620am, for our 730am departure. Our ride picked us up and drove us from Pisco to Paracas. The ride is quick and only takes about 15 minutes. We were driven to the 	wharf in Paracas, which is a nice, sleepy little town on the pacific. If one has the option of staying in Paracas, or staying in Pisco, stay in Paracas. Pisco is a sad, ghost of a town that is still deeply affected by the 2007 earthquake that struck and essentially leveled the town, and due to the construction a permanent haze of dust hangs over the place. Paracas on the other hand is a cheery place with an ocean front view and a variety of options for places to stay at. We made the mistake of staying in Pisco, partly because we arrived so late at night.

Once at the wharf, we got in line with all the other tourists to board one of the many boats that go to Ballestas Islands. After a few minutes we were shuttled onto one of the long, skinny boats and given seats in the very back row. Once on our way to the Islands, approximately a 30 minute boat ride, it became very apparent why sitting in the back is a bad idea. While the ride is not very bumpy, one gets sprayed periodically by a large splash of ocean water. This isnât too bad, until you find it seeping down your seat and into your pants.

The islands themselves are dubbed the âPoor manâs Galapagosâ and I would say that is a good description. While there are hundreds of thousands of birds, the actual variation of wildlife is quite limited. It is an interesting place, but I would never consider it a replacement for the fabled Galapagos. The whole tour lasts a little over two hours, which is plenty of time for the islands in my opinion. You can only take so many pictures of the same animals.

We were back in Pisco by lunchtime and grabbed lunch before embarking to Ica. We caught one of the myriad of buses that plies the Panamerican highway and one hour later were in Ica. Once in Ica, we caught a cab to Huacachina, which is a desert Oasis surrounding the little town of Ica. The town of Ica is unremarkable, except for the myriad of Pisco wineries that fill the area. Called the âNapa of Peruâ, the wineries offer free tours with free tastings. After taking the quick cab ride to Huacachina and locating a place to stay, we signed up for a two winery and one chocolate factory tour to occupy our afternoon. Almost all the hotels and a myriad of private operators offer wine tours, so it is very easy and cheap to find one.

The first winery we visited, <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304040-d318929-Reviews-Bodegas_Vista_Alegre-Ica.html">Vista Alegre</a>, was a great place to learn about the making of Pisco. Pisco is a hard alcohol that is created from wine itself. It has a very light flavor and smells like a mix of rum and alcohol. Vista Alegre was an interesting in an educational sense, but the next place we visited was just plain fun. <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304040-d318927-Reviews-Bodega_El_Catador-Ica.html">El Catador</a>, the name of the second Pisco place, had a guide (if you can ask for Chemo, then joke with the ladies at the desk that heâs a bit overweight :P ) who was simply amazing. His grasp of English slang was the best I had seen, and he was able to crack jokes and explain the Pisco process in good detail. At the end he provided us with a serious tasting session that ended after about 8 shots. It felt more like a fraternity initiation rather than a tasting.  By the time we were ready to leave, we were stumbling to our cab, but absolutely satisfied. Hey, I mean we bought a couple of bottles. The chocolate factory turned out to be simply a chocolate store with some windows to peer in at the people making the chocolate. Since, Liz is a chocolate snob, and the place only had milk chocolate, we did not purchase anything. However, Hope and Josh bought about 8 pieces and ate them in about 2 minutes. I was both disgusted and impressed.

After the tour, we stopped by the grocery store on the way back to buy dinner. We opted for chicken in celebration of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, and also because it looked delicious. We inhaled the chicken and soon after found that all we could do was watch a movie and drift off to sleep. It really is amazing how many things one can accomplish when they are not working.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Huacachina and then to Arequipa</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[**Pictures are to come, I haven't had enough time to go through them yet :)

Today we spent the day in the sleepy, desert oasis of Huacachina. The town itself was originally built for Peruvian elite as a weekend getaway place. However, now it has become more of a tourist party destination for young people. The bars blare music late into the night and things are slow to start in the morning. We decided to relocate to a different hotel for the day where we could get a better deal on the dayâs activities.

On a side note, Iâd just like to provide some information for any that travel to Huacachina, since most guidebooks have almost no information on the place. While going to the town in a cab, the cabby will suggest a place to stay if you do not have one. You can go to this place, but understand he is being paid to bring you there. You can inquire about the prices and then politely leave and look for other accommodation. What one must realize is that the lagoon is studded with places to stay, eat, and relax. Donât just settle on the first one. For instance, Casa de Arena, is a nice place for a pool, but their rooms are dirty, hot, and too well-used. Plus, they are more expensive both for their room prices and their buggy/sandboarding excursions. It has the feel of a factory. However, with just a short walk down the street, you can find places to camp, other hotels, and better deals on excursions. We found a very accommodating place called Bananas Lodge that was cheaper, cleaner and with nicer clientele. The moral here is, donât just settle, but look around for other options. Also, most places for Huacachina are not listed online or in guide books, but once there you can find many, many options.

Once arranging our dayâs activities, which would be a sunset Dune Buggy and Sandboarding tour, we relaxed by the pool and drank fresh, frozen juices. We actually ended up meeting some very nice Peace Corps (Piece Core according to one of their shirts :P) who were actually working in Caraz, which is just down the street from Huaraz. It was great to compare stories and experiences. They ended up accompanying us on the buggy tour later in the day.

The buggy tour itself is extremely fun. The buggies are rolling cages that scream up and down the surrounding dunes. They whisk you to the top, where you can slide down the face on a wooden plank, then pick you up at the bottom only to take you to the next dunes and do it all over again. The actual boarding is great fun. You get much more speed by laying on your stomach, and covering the bottom of the board in wax. The only trick is to keep you elbows tucked, so as not to have your hair and possibly skin removed by the high speed. I really recommend the 2.5 hour excursion to watch the sunset, be driven through sand dunes, and then slide down them at mach speed. Liz found out the hard way what falling means, sand everywhere. Everywhere!

After the ride, we took a shower, and jumped in a cab to the bus station. We boarded our bus to take us to Arequipa. Liz and I will spend the next couple of days taking in the city and arranging a tour, weâre thinking a couple day hiking trip, to the Colca Canyon. The Colca Canyon is actually deeper than the Grand Canyon, but not as steep. Overall, traveling through Peru is turning out being a lot easier than traveling to the various rural schools of Ancash. Oh yeah, HAPPY TURKEY DAY. Iâm thankful for dune buggies and sand boards, what are you thankful for?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nov 26 - Arequipa and some Tasty Foods</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Liz and I departed Ica around 8pm and spent the night sleeping on the bus, which never results in a truly great nightâs sleep. This could be due to the uncomfortable seats, the loud crappy movie, or just the young punks sitting in front of you that want stop talking. Upon arriving in Arequipa on the Friday the 26<sup>th</sup> of November, Liz and I took a taxi to the hostel that we had booked. On a side note, weâve started using a site called hostelbookers.com which provides an easy way to sift through places and read reviews. The hostel we chose was Marlonâs House Arequipa, and it was a very good choice. It is an extremely clean hostel with fairly decent amenities. They are part of a chain, but this does not detract from the value they offer. We got a private room for 6$ per person, with a shared bathroom. One of the best things about hostels is they are really flexible on the time you arrive, which means if you take a night bus and get into town around 8am they wonât bug you about check-in time.

After dropping of our bags, it was still very early in the morning, we went in search of food. We settled on a Middle Eastern place called Fezâs CafÃ©, which had amazing falafel. Their falafel was absolutely top-notch and if you find yourself in Arequipa, Peru, I highly recommend it.

Since Arequipa is close to what is called the Colca Canyon, a canyon deeper than the grand canyon, we decided that we would do a trek in the canyon. These treks are quite popular and there are a myriad of tour companies all within a few blocks of one another. After checking with a bunch of companies, in search of the best price, we decided to actually go with our hostelâs tour company. They offered the best price, plus with the added convenience of being able to leave our bags at the hostel, it was the easiest route.

After arranging our trek, a 3Day/2Night excursion, we spent the rest of the afternoon looking around Arequipa. Arequipa, in my opinion, is the nicest city in Peru. It is clean, orderly, pretty, and cultured. The architecture is a beautiful colonial style made mostly out of Sillar stone (a volcanic stone readily available in the surrounding area). The residents walk around with the trendiest new fashions. However, and this is the most important part, the food is the best Iâve had in Peru.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Arequipan Plaza by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5225551040/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5209/5225551040_59c3f0ae15_z.jpg" alt="Arequipan Plaza" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Arequipan Plaza</em></p>
For sight-seeing we visited the Santa Catalina Monastery, a prison for Nuns, I mean a place of worship. It is a megalith of a complex that is only partly used now by a group of about 39 prisoners, sorry, Nuns. The architecture is very colonial and the layout is much like a small city. Rooms tended to be very Spartan and accompanied with a small place for a wood fire. After the monastery, we visited the Plaza de Armas and the main market. The market was quite impressive as it houses a huge amount of fruits, veggies, hat stalls, huge variety of nic-nacs, ready to eat empanadas &amp; papa rellenos, fresh juice stations, and of course the meat butcher stations (which donât smell so nice).

We decided to do dinner at a restaurant where we could eat some typical Arequipan dishes. Liz and I settled on a place that offered us free Pisco Sours, essentially the national drink of Peru, and ordered two typical dishes. We ordered Roccoto Relleno and Adobo. The Rocotto Relleno is a stuffed rocotto pepper served with a potato covered in cheese, very delicious. The Adobo was a slow braised piece of pork with a delicious sauce that I sopped up using the bread. We were VERY satisfied with the meal.

After dinner we retired to the hostel for an early night because we were going to have to get up at 245am the following morning for the 330am pickup for our trek. We did not have trouble going to sleep early though, considering the prior night had been spent on a bus, which never results in a good nightâs sleep :)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nov 27 - To the Canyon and Down the Rabbit Hole</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our Colca Canyon trek began early on Saturday morning at about 245am. We were up and finished packing for the 330am pickup. When the van arrived we groggily got in. The van proceeded to pick up the other people that would be joining us on the trek. Many hostels organize the 3D/2N trek and then pool the people into a group. As the van slowly filled, we gave each other tired, awkward hellos. Eventually, everybody was accounted for and the 3 hour drive to the canyon was underway.

On the ride there, most people drifted in and out of sleep. Beyond the initial hello and pep talk given to us by our guide, we really did not talk much. Around 7am, we arrived in Chivay which is a sleepy mountain town at about 3600m. We were served breakfast here and stocked up on various supplies like water and snacks (mostly chocolate it seemed). After a decent breakfast, we were shuttled off to the Condor Lookout, which is a point in the canyon where one can view the canyon and the condors that live in it.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Colca Canyon by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5225562856/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5241/5225562856_6a9103a8da_z.jpg" alt="Colca Canyon" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Colca Canyon at Condor Lookout</em></p>
This is a very busy area full of tourists waiting to see the elusive bird flying around. Luckily we were able to see a couple of the birds while there. They are actually quite massive.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Peruvian Condor by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5224966171/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5005/5224966171_632589d293_z.jpg" alt="Peruvian Condor" width="522" height="640" /></a>
<em>Condor </em></p>
The canyon itself was also quite beautiful, and although deeper than the Grand Canyon in the USA, its walls are not as steep and its colors not as vibrant. It makes it a more hospitable place, allowing people to live there, but in my opinion slightly less breath-taking than the Grand Canyon.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Do Not Pass by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5225562236/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5045/5225562236_b4af97054e_z.jpg" alt="Do Not Pass" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Do Not Pass</em></p>
After our time at the lookout, we shuttled off down the road towards the town of Cabanaconde. At this point we met our guide, Chemi (his real name is Ricardo), and although it was only 10am, were served lunch. After our lunch, around 1130am, we began our trek. Now while I normally wonât complain about stopping to eat, it did happen to mean that we had to start our walk when the sun was essentially at its peak.

After lunch, we began walking through a series of fields to reach the canyon rim. After about 20 minutes we got to the edge and were able to assess the task in front of us. Chemi informed us that our downward mission would take about 3 hours. Now while I have quite a bit of experience with walking in Peru (see previous two months of posts), many of the people on the trek did not. You could see the fear in their eyes and excitement on their faces. Chemi, knowingly looking at the three guys on the trek, told us that there is only one path down and there is a bridge at the bottom, and if anybody got there quickly, they should wait at the bridge. With those words in mind we plunged off down the trail.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Colca Canyon Ridge by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5224965477/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5083/5224965477_fe8aea3be8_z.jpg" alt="Colca Canyon Ridge" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Colca Canyon at the Ridge</em></p>
Soon enough I found myself walking with the two other guys, both British fellows, at the front of the group with quite a gap between us and the rest of the group. The trail itself was dusty and rocky, but nothing I had not encountered before. John and Eric, mid-20s financial advisers, had recently finished the Inca Trail and did not find the Colca descent too challenging either. In fact, despite the three hours it took to get to the bridge, time flew as we discussed a myriad of topics (credit cards, American politics, British politics, to name a few).

Liz was walking in the middle of the pack with an Australian-Thai girl named Mae. They found the trail a bit more difficult, but also felt time fly as they discussed their various lives. Mae had lived in Thailand for the past three years, where she had taught English, built a house, and then sold it to finance her next bout of travels to another continent. They reached the bridge about 10 minutes after we did. Right before them, a trio of French girls arrived. Mary, Mary, and Melin had spent the last few weeks or so between a few south American countries. Bringing up the tail was Suzanna, a writer from Australia, and Gloria, and elderly lady from Spain, along with Chemi.

After we assembled at the bridge, we walked the next 15 minutes to our camp. I use the word camp loosely, because it was more like a lodge. It had hot water, rooms with windows, a big room where we could hang out, I mean, after having roughed it in the Cordillera Negra, this was like heaven. Once at the lodge, we all took showers, relaxed, stretched, and then spent the rest of the night playing cards. After having walked downhill for so long, everybodyâs knees felt a little wobbly.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Roy's Lodge by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5224964649/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5290/5224964649_950c9dddc6_z.jpg" alt="Roy's Lodge" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Roy's Lodge at the end of the day</em></p>
Lucky for John, he found a new friend in the local dog, Bobby. In fact, John may have become a little too close to the dog. John claims the sounds we heard during the night were them playing, but who really knows.

Considering the lodge had no electricity, we all turned in relatively early. This was partly due to the candles running out and partly due to us having to wake up early. Our first day in the Colca Canyon had come to a close.

The next two days are to come soon...]]></content:encoded>

<em>Liz looking beautiful/happy</em></p>
The second of our trek, Sunday the  28<sup>th</sup>, was supposed to be an early day. While some of the  group was up and ready at the 7am breakfast time, some were still sleeping.  However, as soon as the words banana pancakes were screamed, those still  asleep appeared instantly. After our hearty breakfast of pancakes and  tea, we suited up and were on the trail. Today we were to be walking  along the bottom of the canyon for about 2.5 hours to a town called  Oasis. If you are wondering does the name mean anything, then you would  be absolutely correct.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Liz and Bobby by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5225555438/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5126/5225555438_c5156672eb_z.jpg" alt="Liz and Bobby" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Liz playing with the dog Bobby</em></p>
The hike itself was mostly flat. However,  there was a small climb that was really only bad due to the hot sun  hitting the face of the hill that we had to climb. The overall climb  really only took about 20 minutes at most, and after that it was downhill.  In fact, as we started going downhill, Oasis came into view. To fully  appreciate this site you have to imagine this: desolate canyon walls,  minimal water, hot sun, and in the distance a green patch spotted with  blue. What is the blue you might ask? Well, those are pools. Pools,  in the middle of the Peruvian countryside, wow. You know you are a tourist  when where you are going has a pool in the middle of nowhere. Nevertheless,  this caused everyone to pick up their pace and as we trickled into the  lodge area one-by-one we as quickly jumped into the pool.

After everyone had had a good dip and  was able to cool off a bit, we went back to the cards until lunch time.  At lunch time, no one hesitated to wolf down a large amount of pasta.  After a few hour walk during the day, everyone was absolutely famished.  Since Liz can no longer eat gluten, I got to have her portion of pasta.  To combat the post-lunch lull, we returned to our card game. Eventually,  the lodge was able to scrounge up a volleyball and the group played  about 2.5 hours of volleyball together. If I remember correctly, the  guy team won. However, some might debate you on that.

Unfortunately, after the end of the  volleyball game I began to have a serious headache. It was soon followed  by chills. I figured that I just needed to rest and take a nap. So I  took a nap and only woke up for dinner. However, I felt no appetite  whatsoever. I was only able to eat the soup. Following dinner, my stomach  began to hurt, along with my head, so I went to bed immediately after  eating. My night of sleep was terrible. My mind raced and I couldnât  get any proper rest. The icing on the cake was our 430am wake up call  for the 5am departure and climb out of the canyon. I went to bed hoping  I would feel better by the time I woke up, but I was absolutely wrong.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I woke up in the morning feeling weak and nauseous. Now, some people in our group had elected to pay for mules to cart them up the canyon. If you were in my situation feeling bad and faced with a 1000m+ uphill hike, would you consider getting a mule? That is what I thought, you would not. You have pride and would never consider such a thing. At least, that is what went through my head. Instead, Liz slowly walked me up the canyon. We went at a snailâs pace, since I felt weak and needed to take lots of stops. Eventually the people riding the mules passed us; one of the girls smoking a cigarette in the process.  Did I contemplate stopping one of them to ask for help? Nope!

As the climb continued, my pace became slower and slower. I am very lucky that Liz is so patient. She did not hassle me about being slow. She stayed with me the whole way, although shaking her head at why I was doing this. She repeatedly asked me to give her my pack, but I refused. If I was going to hike up, even sick, I was going to do it with my own pack. Often times she mumbled under her breath about stupid man pride, or something like that, I chose to ignore it and focus on putting one foot in front of the other. As we neared the top, my situation actually worsened. I had to stop at one point to answer natureâs call. The hard part about that is the trail was the only flat thing to stand on, so I pushed aside some rocks and made sure Liz held up anybody coming behind us.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Feeling not so good by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5224957187/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5122/5224957187_98cf97c248_z.jpg" alt="Feeling not so good" width="640" height="499" /></a>
<em>Feeling not so good</em></p>
After about 3 hours we reached the top. While most people were celebrating at this point, I was merely trying to keep myself composed. After resting a bit, we took off for the 15 minute walk over flat ground to town. While this should normally be the easiest part for anybody, it turned out to be the hardest for me. My stomach decided to kick into overdrive and it felt like someone was twisting my intestines. I was able to walk for about a minute before I had to sit down. Eventually we were able to reach the edge of town and I rushed into the first place with a bathroom. As for what happened in there, well, take whatever youâre imagining and double it.

After I finished up, we walked the next three blocks to the restaurant where we were supposed to have brekkie. I simply laid down outside on the sidewalk, dust be damned. Liz cradled my head in her lap like a baby, and the others in the group were genuinely concerned. Mei offered me some apricots, which I guess I thought might be a good idea to try and eat, although I had no appetite. However, within about a minute of them hitting my stomach I projectile vomited into the gutter. Let me clarify a bit more, I vomited green. The upside to having vomited was that I actually felt a lot better and was able to stand up after that. I joined the group inside for brekkie, and gave away the food that was supposed to be mine. I opted to only drink powerade.

After brekkie, we got into our van and began the drive back towards Arequipa. Along with the tour, we are supposed to stop along the way to see a few sights. However, the road we found was soon blocked by a truck that could not make it up the hill. Therefore, we had to detour to the other side of the canyon, which slightly prolonged our journey. I was mostly delirious, so it was not a big deal for me. Our first stop was at some hot springs close to Chivay, where all in the group, except me, bathed in nice hot spring water. I figured that the last thing I wanted to do was subject my digestive system to a steam bath.

When everyone was clean and bathed, we drove into Chivay for a buffet lunch. I opted for crackers instead, not wanting to push my luck. When lunch was finished, we piled back into the van for the drive back to Arequipa. The only stop we had was at the top of the pass, 4910m, to view the surrounding volcano peaks. It was a short stop because it was freezing out and we did not linger for long. This was the last stop on our drive back, and before we knew it we were saying our goodbyes to our new friends and going our separate ways. While I had suffered the last day, the overall trip was an awesome, irreplaceable experienc. The group was great and made the trip one that will never be forgotten.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was spent looking around at the sights, catching up on the internet, and testing tasty foods at the market. Liz had her first Papa Relleno and first Empenada. She loved both. The biggest sight we saw was the Casa de Moral. Not moral, like in how you conduct yourself, but moral like the really old tree in the middle of the courtyard. It was a very nice colonial house with a great rooftop view. It was really nice to take a relax day after the trek, and to also let my stomach return to normal. We had to catch an 11pm bus to Puno, so our night was unfortunately not spent out on the town :(

		<title>Dec 1 - The (floating) islands of Lake Titikaka</title>
		<link>http://jeffpatzer.com/2010/12/01/dec-1-the-floating-islands-of-lake-titikaka/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Liz and I arrived on a night bus from Arequipa in Puno at about 5am in the morning. Puno is the small Peruvian town that squats between the edge of Lake Titikaka and surrounding mountains. Itâs quite high at around 3800m. Lake Titikaka (LT) is the highest and largest navigable lake in the world. While there are lakes that are bigger in size, none are bigger at this altitude.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Lake Titikaka by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5229762689/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5048/5229762689_0b1c6b60dd_z.jpg" alt="Lake Titikaka" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Lake Titikaka</em></p>
After gathering our bags, Liz and I proceeded into the bus terminal. The bus terminals are much like airport terminals, except that they are full of people that attack any tourist as soon as they step into the building. We were quickly pestered with questions about tours, hostals, hotels, taxis, and any other variety of services. We already had a hostal, so we flagged down a taxi and took off. When we arrived at the hostal we were able to arrange a tour of the floating islands and a larger island in the main part of the lake. We also arranged our bus for the next day to go to Cusco. All this was done before 6am in the morning.

After dropping our bags in our room, we got picked up for our tour at 645am. The van drove us to the docks we boarded a boat with about 15 other people. After a few minutes the boat shoved off and we were on our way to the Uros floating islands. The islands are man-made out of reeds. Since they are reeds, they have to continually be building the islands to keep them afloat. There are approximately 60 islands, each with its own person in charge. The islands originally came into existence because the inhabitants wanted to escape harassment from the Incas, now they are mostly just tourists. In fact, most of the inhabitants live in Puno, and come out to the islands for the tourists. There is a rotation system in place to make sure each island gets a fair number of visitors.

As one motors into the islands, one canât help but feel as if they are entering a Peruvian Disneyland. The inhabitants are cheery, wave at the boats, and beckon you to their islands with long sweeping gestures. Once on the island you are greeted with a hearty hello in the native language and enthusiastically encouraged to snap as many pictures as you want.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Island Resident by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5230357932/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5003/5230357932_d3d089904c_z.jpg" alt="Island Resident" width="425" height="640" /></a>
<em>Island Resident</em></p>
The guide sits everyone down and they launch into a mini-demonstration of how the islands are built. The bottoms of the islands are made of a cork-like material, then reeds are piled cross-thatch style on top of those pieces. Theses many little pieces are then lashed together and anchored to the bottom of the lake. The lake is shallow where the islands are located. After the demonstration you are invited into a house, where you can take more pictures, and then are ushered outside to the view all the goods available for sale. After being plied to buy the trinkets, you are then offered a ride, for a small fee of course, on a large boat that looks like a Viking ship but is made out of reeds. After the floating islands you are piled back into the motor boat to begin the journey into the main lake and the island of Taquile.

The trip from the floating islands, in a protected inlet, to the main lake takes about 2.5 hours. Most people fall asleep due to the slow rocking of the boat. The boat actually drives barely above no-wake speed, which I have to wonder is done on purpose to lengthen the trip. I mean, there really isnât any surf and barely any wind, but either way, we got there, if not slowly. Upon arrival at the island, one is greeted with a sign that has a few instructions, only one of which is really worth repeating âDonât feed the children candyâ. When I read that I thought it sounded more like donât feed the wildlife, they might become accustomed to the food and not want to hunt their own food anymore. Honestly, I think candy isnât the issue. Any kid on the island is trying to sell you things, not take candy from you.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Island Girl by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5230354132/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5247/5230354132_6486d2e200_z.jpg" alt="Island Girl" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Island Girl</em></p>
After the sign and entrance, we climbed a short path to the house of a typical family. Once at the house, the family performed a dance and then drug up a few people to dance with them. I was lucky enough for that to happen. I realized that as soon as they were looking they would target me, I was sitting close to the front and appeared young and willing. See video to watch me embarrass myself. Apparently the translation of the song being sung was mostly âKiss me, Kiss meâ. Oh boy.

After the dance we were served a lunch of soup and trout. It was actually quite good, especially compared to what I was used to. Following lunch we continued up the slope to the top of the island and the plaza. Here in the plaza one is obliged to visit the craft shop and perhaps purchase a few things. The island actually produces a multitude of crafts, which are of very fine quality. I would honestly say that they are the best quality I have seen in Peru. The island is actually quite an interesting place in regards to arts and crafts. There is a hat and pompom system that is used to determine oneâs married status and place in the community. If you are a single man, you have a certain hat. If you are a single woman, your pompoms are big.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="BomBoms by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5230356884/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5203/5230356884_ace7b2ef81_z.jpg" alt="BomBoms" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>PomPoms</em></p>
If you are a kid, you have a hat that is designed after a flower. If you are the boss of the area, you wear a rainbow hat. The use of this system does make it easy to discern oneâs status, but I would imagine also takes the fun out of dating. I mean if you didnât have to guess whether or not a girl had a boyfriend, where would all the adrenaline go that accompanies the process?

After the plaza, we walked the 2 km around the edge of the island to a different port to get back on our boat. The walk was easy and the path essentially paved. Upon getting to the boat, I tested the water temp and found that it was actually a bit warmer than Tahoe. You could swim in it, I would have if I had a change of clothes, on a warm day if you wanted to. The boat ride back was long and uneventful. Once again the boat puttered along at about the speed I can kayak. Eventually we did get back to town though and were able to return to our hostel. We decided that we were tired of eating carbohydrates in all its various forms that it gets served in Peru, so we ventured to the market (not like super market, like open-air market) and bought a load of vegetables. Liz whipped up a vegetable stir-fry for dinner, which in my opinion was amazing. Although, since my stomach was still a bit touchy, all the forage sent me to the bathroom fairly fast, but I think it was more than worth it.

Although we had only been in Puno for a day, we had exhausted most of its attractions by visiting the lakes. In fact, Punoâs similarity to Huaraz, did not entice me to linger longer. The next day we would be traveling to Cusco via bus. There is a well-known train that runs the route as well, but for about 220$ per person. Liz and I opted for the bus which costs 12$ per person, and follows the same path. While the Islands in LT were touristy, they were very interesting and possess a culture that does not exist in any other parts of the world.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dec 2 - From Puno to Cusco</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The trip from Puno to Cusco can be done in three ways. The first is to fly, almost no one does this due to price. The second is via train, some tourists do this, but it is very expensive (220$ for a 7 hour ride). The third is by bus, which is the manner most often chosen. The bus follows almost the same line as the train, but at about 1/25 the cost. The road from Puno to Cusco is known to be breathtaking and beautiful. It is for this reason alone that Liz and I decided to do the day bus. Normally I am a fan of the night bus, which allows one to save money and time (you donât have to stay somewhere and you travel while you sleep). 

The bus left at around 8am and for the first 2 hours or so, the landscape remained similar to the Peru we were already familiar with, dry and rocky. However, after that the scenery changed and became more grassy in appearance, with less rocks, and more water. In fact the closer we got to Cusco the more green the scenery became. The overall bus ride finished a bit earlier than we expected, so we made use of our time in the bus station to book tickets back to Lima. After we had tickets to Lima squared away, we grabbed a taxi and headed to our hostel. 

The odd thing about Cusco, is how the place changes once you reach a certain part of the city. The city center, or where most of the tourist things are located, is a beautiful and quaint little area. The surrounding area outside of the plaza de armas, looks just like any other Peruvian town. One can feel the change as the cross a few streets into the downtown area. The colonial architecture appears and tour operators begin to harass you. For some reason, the people in Cusco think that every tourist wants a massage. If you want through the plaza de armas, you are guaranteed to be offered a massage by about 15 people. This can become very annoying, very fast. 

Liz and I occupied our time for the rest of the afternoon with exploring. We topped off the day with a nice dinner where Liz was able to try Cuy, or guinea pig, for the first time. She seemed to like it, but says that quail or pigeon tastes better. I had alpaca, which looks like chicken but tastes like steak, and is delicious. It makes me want to raise some alpacas, just to eat them!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Liz and I were both up at 6am today. Donât ask why, we donât know either. However, it allowed us to get an early start on the day. We were out the door by 8am and by 930am had already booked our train tickets to Machu Pichu, bought the tourist ticket that would allow us to visit a myriad of museums and ruins in the area and the sacred valley, and arranged a ATV tour for the next day.

After being so efficient by this time of the morning, we decided that we would spend a good part of the day seeing the four ruin sites close to town. We grabbed a taxi to the farthest ruin, which would allow us to walk back towards town stopping at the ruins along the way. The ruins themselves were fairly impressive and varied. The first we visited was a bathing place. The second a fortress to protect the bathing place. The third a ritual center with a cave cut out of the rocks. The last was a monolithic fortress that was extremely large. Since we had walked about 4 miles by the time we had reached the last place, we were somewhat exhausted. So we found a quiet place where we could lie down on some nice grass and take a nap. We later found out after wandering through the place, that we had actually taken a nap in the cemetery, which explained why it was so quiet.

After the ruins, and about 5 hours of sight-seeing and walking between the ruins, we walked back to town where we bought food to make dinner. We returned to the hostel where we took a chance to rest our feet, catch up on the internet, and make dinner. Liz actually came down with an upset stomach so we did not do much the rest of the night except watch TV and make the occasional run to the bathroom. The day overall was interesting and exciting, including the excitement brought on by stomach pain!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dec 4 - ATVing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today Liz and I were up and out the door by 8am for our 9am rendezvous with the ATV tour company. Walking around Cusco the day before Liz had sighted the ATV tour option, and decided that she needed to do that. We had signed up for their half-day tour that would allow us to ride up into the hills around Cusco, and visit a couple tracks. By 930am we had arrived at the starting point. I had chosen to ride a 250cc motorcycle while Liz had opted for the Honda ATV.

We met our guide and were given a few minutes to ride around and get used to the machines. We were given a bare-bones safety talk, a warning that insurance was not provided (although I did get personal insurance with the bike), and a sheet with a list of prices for parts if we broken them. After this we clambered onto the machines and took off up the dirt tracks leading away from Cusco. After a short ride we reached a soccer field where we were allowed to ride in circles. I used this time to see how fast I could get the motorcycle going (fairly quick). After a bit of this, we continued on up the tracks.

After a while of meandering over tracks we arrived at a house where our guide told us we could stop for a break to buy a drink or a snack if we wanted. Liz and I opted to eat the food we had brought with us. At this point our guide got a call on his cell phone from a friend close-by that had crashed. He rushed off to help while we hung out for a bit. During the 20 minute period that he was gone, we were hit by a sudden rain fall. Liz and I remained dry under the overhang, but when our guide got back it appeared he did not have the same luck.
We continued on the roads until we reached a small track where you could ride down a small dip and then scream back up the hill to get some air off a little jump. My only complaint about this was that the machines werenât geared well enough to get more air. The problem with rental equipment is my guess. After the track we headed back down the hills to the starting point. We were given a coke and some soda crackers for a snack, then piled into a cab back to the main plaza. After having watched Liz ride the quad and see how she was pushing the speed limit, I fear she may become a gearhead! I think this might have been the first time that after a adrenaline activity, she told me she wanted more time to get faster. When I took her mountain biking, she was simply yelling at me because she was scared. But for some reason, give her a quad and she becomes a speed demon :P

<em>Catching more air</em></p>
We returned back to our hostel and gather our things. We had decided that we would give another hostel a try that night. We hoofed our things to the new place, which was much newer, nicer, and oddly, cheaper. The new place had new bathrooms, new rooms, lots of activities, lots of backpackers, and just much more going on. We dropped our things off, and went in search of a quiet cafÃ© to work at for a bit. We decided on a place called Los Perros (The Dogs) which had comfy couches, good food, and (most important for Liz) dogs hanging out inside. After the cafÃ© we returned to the hostel were we relaxed until later that night, when the hostelâs organized party started. Dubbed the âSexy Circusâ, it had a juggling clown, DJ, lights, and all other sorts of entertainment. Liz and I joined in on the festivities for a while, and then decided to go to head off to bed. While the music did play for some time (loudly), the only time I can say that I woke up was when the music shut off. The sudden change woke me up, but I quickly acknowledged the quiet and nodded back off to sleep. I can only imagine how much things must have sucked for the people getting up early for the Inca Trail, but then again, if you knew the place was going to have a party that night I might have tried to locate a different hostel.]]></content:encoded>

Liz and I were on the bus from Puno to Cusco, when we began to develop a myriad of small red bumps. Well, my were small, Lizâs looked more like welts. As time wore on, they began to itch terribly. I mean, the type of itching that begins to control your every thought. You think about itching, you try to figure out ways to itch, you contemplate how to make the itching more efficient. By the end of the day, both Liz and I were completely consumed with the notion that every little red bump had to be scratched. However, the other thing that was bugging us (pardon the pun), was what had caused the red bumps. 

At first, we contemplated that perhaps we were allergic to something. However, knowing that we have no clothes or food allergies, we ruled that out. After looking over the bites again, we figured they might be some sort of mosquito bites. However, that didnât fit because we had not come into contact with mosquitoes recently. The next thought that we discussed was bed bugs. The problem was that neither of us had any idea what bed bug bites should look like or the symptoms they should induce. To remedy this lack of knowledge we looked up what bed bug bites should look like, and sure enough, it was exactly what we had contracted. 

The last question Liz and I felt we needed to answer was, where did we get attacked by the bugs? After reading that the bites appear about 4-5 hours after being bitten, we assumed it was our hotel room in Puno. This really surprised us, because the place seemed quite nice. However, the timeline fit, so it must have been there. 

The problem with bed bug bites, is they itch like the devil, but there isnât much you can do about them. You can put on soothing cream, but the only remedy it to wait them out. This can last a few days. In fact, as I write this, I still itch. Luckily, the bugs themselves do not carry diseases. Unluckily, they are extremely difficult to eradicate. They are microscopic, and as such, cannot be seen. To deal with this issue, one essentially has to steam their clothes and kill any potential bugs that still linger. If this does not solve the problem, then throwing out your clothes is the only next option. 

A valuable lesson has been learned though, hostel living is not also the healthiest or safest, but is an intricate part of the travel experience.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This Sunday was a relaxation day, partly out of necessity. Liz was experiencing stomach pain a lot of the day. Essentially whenever she ate anything, she felt like knives were wedging themselves into her abdomen. As a result she spent most of the day sleeping, while I visited museums. Eventually she awoke for the afternoon and we meandered over to a bar owned by an American where we watched football (American football, not the type where they run around falling and crying whenever they get close to each other :P). We were able to squeeze in a few hours before we needed to return to the hostal so Liz could get more rest. Overall the day was quiet, I mean Liz was asleep most of the time, and easy-going.

On a side note, the museums I visited were somewhat underwhelming. They were both small, had very little collections, and the pieces they did have were quite mediocre. The two I visited were the Museum of Regional History and the Museum of Popular Art.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dec 6 - Sacred Valley here we come</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today Liz felt a bit better and as a result, we were able to make our way into the Sacred Valley. We were in a Colectivo around 10am and off for the 1 hour ride into the Sacred Valley. Since Liz had spent the previous day in bed, we had to skip the town of Pisaq and go straight to Ollantaytambo. The Sacred Valley, lying north of Cusco, is dotted with small towns which are usually accompanied with close-by ruins. Ollantaytambo is the last town in the Sacred Valley before one has to board a train to Machu Picchu.

Liz and I arrived in Ollantaytambo a little after lunch. After finding a hostal, we went in search of food. When we had finished eating our meal, we decided to visit the close-by ruins. Now, when I say close-by, I really mean close-by. The town sits in a small valley and is guarded over by a massive set of ruins that starts at the edge of town and stretches up the hillside. Starting at the bottom of the hill one climbs up the terraces until you reach the top. You are treated to a series of old houses and other structures along the way. Overall, although a small set of ruins, it is quite impressive. After the ruins, Liz and I spent the rest of the day watching some shows and reading our books. Since I did not have internet I could not waste my time on that endeavor (sadly).

		<title>Dec 7 - On to Aguas Calientes </title>
		<link>http://jeffpatzer.com/2010/12/07/dec-7-on-to-aguas-calientes/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first part of the day was slow and easy. We did not have to be on our train to Aguas Calientes until 1230pm, so we spent the morning packing and eating Choclo con Queso, Maize with Cheese. By the time we actually got on the train, there was a slight drizzle, which didnât let up until much later in the afternoon.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Train Ride by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5252707033/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5085/5252707033_4f8452a174_z.jpg" alt="Train Ride" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Train Ride</em></p>
<strong>A quick note on the logistics of Machu Picchu, if you arenât interested, simply skip past this section, but the overall logistics are quite interesting. </strong>Machu Picchu itself is located up a valley that is only accessible two ways: by train or by hiking the Inca Trail. While I have heard rumor that you can take a colectivo, this manner is most likely limited to locals and has been known to be very dangerous. The geography itself demands that there are no roads, plus I think Peru Rail enjoys the monopoly it has over the service. There are two companies that one can take, Peru Rail and Inka Rail. Peru rail is the biggest and most popular, offering multiple types of services and times. There is a highly exclusive level that leaves and returns to Cusco costs about 600$ roundtrip. The next level is slightly more reasonable and leaves and returns to Ollantaytambo for about 180$ roundtrip. The cheapest option, cheerfully dubbed the âBackpackers Trainâ (really thatâs the name, Iâm not making it up), leaves and returns to Ollantaytambo for about 63$. Inka rail is about 90$ round trip, with similar service.

The trains themselves donât go to the site of Machu Picchu. They go to a small town at the base of the mountains, next to the river, called Aguas Calientes or Machu Picchu Pueblo. I think they are trying to rebrand to the latter, but are not having much success since everyone I talk to calls it by the former. AG is a town built almost exclusively to serve tourists on their way to MP. There are places to eat, places to stay, and places to shop. Not much else. The good thing is that if you are in the low season, haggling is extremely easy, as all the restaurants and hostels are fighting for business.

The tickets for MP have to be bought in AG and cannot be purchased at the entrance to MP. The tickets are 44$ for adults, or half that for students. To get to MP, one can either do the 1.5hr walk up to the entrance or pay the 7$ (expensive by Peruvian standards) to take a 15min bus up. Buses run from AG up to MP about every 15 minutes, after the initial morning rush. The first buses leave around 530am, which means if you want a decent spot you have to arrive about 45 minutes early to line up to get on the bus. You have to buy a bus ticket before getting on the bus and can either buy a roundtrip ticket, or a one way. If you are in decent shape you can hike up and hike back, but Liz and I decided to only hike back (downhill is so much easier).

Once you get to MP you have to queue up to get into the site. The guards come down the line asking if youâd like a ticket to climb Huanay Pichu (the mountain behind MP). They only allow 400 people total to do this a day, so if you are not early, you canât get a ticket to do this. Many people hiking the Inca Trail cannot get these tickets during the high season because they arrive a bit after the bus crowd has arrived. In fact, to get a decent spot and be there early enough to avoid crowds, one has to stay in AG to get up to MP early enough. If you come on morning trains, you donât arrive until around 10am, and if you hike, you still donât arrive until about 630-7am. Itâs a very convoluted process that took quite a while and many discussions to figure out and decipher. However, once deciphered, you get treated to one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. <strong>Now back to the main story.</strong>

The train ride is very scenic as it slowly tracks farther into the mountains. The hills rise up vertically, reminding one of Jurassic Park (or Kauai if youâve actually been there, which is where Jurassic Park was filmed). The area is known as a cloud forest and is extremely green (stark contrast to the Cordillera Negra). Besides the scenery, the only other memorable thing about the ride was the coffee, which was atrocious. Absolutely atrocious!
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Peruvian Countryside by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253319798/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5006/5253319798_6a06deeb92_z.jpg" alt="Peruvian Countryside" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Peruvian Countryside</em></p>
Once in AG, you disembark and are immediately bombarded by people trying to get you to come eat at a restaurant, stay at a hostal, buy copied painting prints, or any other myriad of things. The entrance to the train station is surrounded by an artisan market, which means to actually get through the town you have to slug your way through a series of stalls and people trying to get you to buy useless crap. Once Liz and I had made it through these various layers, we set off to buy our Machu Picchu tickets and find a place to stay. We were able to swing the student price with our old Cal student IDs for the tickets, which was half-off. This was pretty cool. After this we went on the hunt for a hostal, which turned out to be quite easy. Once one wanders out of the plaza and into the backstreets, one can encounter a myriad of places all looking to serve your needs. Originally Liz and I had planned on camping, but due to the rain we decided against this. We are both familiar with sleeping in a tent in the rain and needless to say, unless forced, it is not something we would willingly do.

Once we found a place with the appropriate price and amenities, we went for a walk around the small town. We had a late lunch, which actually ended up costing us less and having free Pisco sours. Although the restaurants in the town try to charge a service fee, when I saw this on the check, I told the waitress we were not going to pay it. She tried to lower it, but I said that we would pay no service fee, none. She gave up fairly easy which makes me think they just try to do that to get more money from people that donât look at the check. On a side note, it is not customary to tip in Peru, which is why I argued the fee.
After lunch we got food from the market (which is surprisingly well-stocked) for dinner. We looked at some of the shops and generally killed time throughout the day. The town can be walked end-to-end in about 10 minutes, so it is not entirely the largest place. After our exploring, we returned to the hotel to pack and prepare for the big day at Machu Picchu the following day.]]></content:encoded>

<em>To Machu Picchu</em></p>
Today is the day, the day that Liz and I would see the most famous place in South America, Machu Picchu (MP).
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254427102/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5287/5254427102_525a9a4298_z.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Machu Picchu</em></p>
As with anything that is extremely famous and well-known, we had to be up early. Liz and I were up at 345am and out the door by 445am. We walked the block or so to the bus station where we grabbed a place in line. We were not too far back, which was good to know. As we waited for the 520am hour to strike, we listened to music and stared at the wall. Eventually the time came and people began filing onto busses. While shuffling forward we heard the words yelled out âHave your bus ticket in your hand,â to which I thought, âWHAT?!â I had been under the impression, based on my myriad of experiences with Peruvian transportation, that once on the bus we would pay the fare. I was very wrong.  After talking to one of the guards, he informed me we had to buy the tickets at the booth. Well, I ran to the booth, where I had to wait in-line for about 10 minutes to buy the tickets. By the time I finally got the tickets, we were the last two people on the last set of early morning busses. Good luck or bad luck? Iâm not really sure, but I did feel like a dumbass (which was not helped by Liz snickering).

Once on the bus, the 15min ride was easy and quick.  When we arrived at Machu Picchu, we got into the queue to wait for admittance into the famous site.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Clouds by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253827761/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5208/5253827761_854956fd73_z.jpg" alt="Clouds" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Morning Clouds</em></p>
We got our tickets stamped so that we could climb Huanya Pichu (HP), the mountain peak behind Machu Picchu (itâs in all the photos pretty much). Once at the entrance we had to show passports and our student IDs, which is the most rigorous ID check Iâve had in Peru.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Ruin Walking by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253833631/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5253833631_f44fe909ec_z.jpg" alt="Ruin Walking" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Ruin Walking</em></p>
Once inside the gates, we made our way quickly to the back of the site, where the gates to HP are located. We were the first few out of the gate and the first at the top.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Huana Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254441024/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5206/5254441024_1b3ef6b42a_z.jpg" alt="Huana Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Huanya Picchu</em></p>
The climb is almost vertical although quite short. What takes most people about 45mins, took Liz and I only 20. Why you might ask? Because weâre awesome! Why else?
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Afraid of Heights? by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253820711/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5047/5253820711_b4bd143cef_z.jpg" alt="Afraid of Heights?" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Afraid of Heights?</em></p>
Once at the top of the peak, the view is truly amazing. One can take in all of MP and the surrounding valleys and mountains.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254429986/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5209/5254429986_1d479ae8b5_z.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width="480" height="640" /></a>
<em>Machu Picchu and Me</em></p>
There are clouds whipping up the face of the mountain, giving the site a mystic feel. The river rumbles far below the sheer cliffs that surround the site. Liz and I had timed it right, as we arrived at the top right as the sun crested the hills and shown down through the clouds onto MP. Not only did it give me great light for photos :P, but it also was amazingly beautiful. Since Liz and I were some of the first up, we had a good deal of time to simply take in the sight without interruption. Truly, a once in a lifetime experience.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254427102/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5287/5254427102_525a9a4298_z.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Machu Picchu</em></p>
After HP, we made our way slowly back down the vertical, wet, slippery stairs and up the small mini peak over MP. While there was nobody on this small peak (most opt for the bigger one), it did provide another great view of the site.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Inca Cola &amp; Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253814553/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5085/5253814553_f11a1e14fe_z.jpg" alt="Inca Cola &amp; Machu Picchu" width="425" height="640" /></a>
<em>Inca Cola &amp; Machu Picchu</em></p>
Eventually Liz and I were back in the site itself, where we could wander among the buildings. The buildings, architecture, layout, stonework, and almost every other facet (including the tourist density) is unlike anywhere else in Peru.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253831985/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5243/5253831985_47507de41d_z.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Mach Picchu</em></p>
While MP is somewhat like a tourist trap, it is also a one-of-a-kind place that cannot be understood until visited. Until you look out from the main plaza, or temple of three windows, into the vast mountains surrounding the area, you cannot understand the power of the place.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Liz at Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254417830/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5247/5254417830_3ea03dc14e_z.jpg" alt="Liz at Machu Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Liz at Machu Picchu</em></p>
Plus, why give up climbing hundreds of stairs over the course of the day while looking at the ruins? Although, you do begin to feel bad for the elderly visiting the site, I mean, climbing rock stairs at high altitude is hard for anybody.

After spending about 7 hours wandering through the site, playing with Llamas, and taking hundreds of photos, we left the site and began the hike back down the hill.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Admiring the view by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254421800/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5254421800_0f2ba6576e_z.jpg" alt="Admiring the view" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Admiring the view</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Llama beak by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254419806/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5254419806_5652dc70a1_z.jpg" alt="Llama beak" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Llama beak</em></p>
The hike down the hill is mostly steps and took us about 35 minutes. The whole time it drizzled, up until we reached the bottom, when the sun came out. Typical. We grabbed lunch since we were starving and headed to a cafÃ© to hang out until we could leave by train. When we grabbed dinner, it actually induced some serious stomach pain for Liz, so we rested at the train station for a couple of hours until the train took off. Once back in Ollantaytambo, we got a colectivo back to Cusco. By the time we were back in Cusco (2am) we were exhausted and made a bee-line for the hostel. Once there we didnât even bother to shower, but just plopped down in bed and passed out. Despite the stomach pain and late arrival, it was an amazing day.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Liz and I took a bus ride that ended up lasting 24 hours from Cusco to Lima. It was cold in the mountains, hot in the desert, and indeterminably long. We've spent the last few days in Lima eating our brains out and relaxing. We are off to Ecuador tomorrow morning where we hope to get some rafting and beach time in.

		<title>Dec 13 - Goodbye Peru, hello Ecuador</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was all about travel. Liz and I flew from Lima, Peru to Guayaquil, Ecuador. The flight was on LAN airlines, which I must say, is a great airline. Every plane has a TV in the back of every seat and the service is excellent. You can catch LAN flights all over South America for reasonable prices. I highly recommend them if you find yourself in a position to buy a ticket with their company.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Amazon Jungle by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5276794331/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5082/5276794331_8eb5a1ee79_z.jpg" alt="Amazon Jungle" width="640" height="458" /></a>
<em>Ecuadorian Greenery</em></p>
When our 2 hour flight to Ecuador arrived, the biggest difference we felt was the weather. Whereas Lima is temperate, Guayaquil is hot and sticky. I quickly regretted my choice of pants. After getting through customs, which was punctuated by extremely pushy and fussy old ladies who kept trying to cut me in line, we grabbed a cab immediately to the bus terminal. Now, when I say bus terminal, I really mean terminal. As in, terminal like an airport terminal. They have lots of food stalls and large waiting rooms. There are hundreds of buses in a brand new building just waiting to whisk their passengers off to other parts of the country. The bus travel itself is on fairly comfortable busses that only cost about a dollar per hour of travel. This means you can travel just about the entirety of the country for less than 50$.

We found a bus for Riobamba, a stopping off town where we would be able to get a bus to Tena. The bus ride itself was fairly typical of the overall bus experience in South America. I sat next to an oversized lady that made it her priority to overflow and slowly commandeer more of my seat as time went on. Every time the bus stopped, food hawkers jump on trying to sell you every manner of snack food and meat sticks you can imagine. However, where this bus ride differed was the scenery. Guayaquil is extremely tropical and as you drive out of the city the landscape is peppered with banana trees. As you climb slowly higher into the mountains the banana trees disappear to simply be replaced by green. Green everywhere you look. It stretches forever. After the desert landscape of Peru, Ecuadorâs green is simply mind-numbing.

Our bus arrived in Riobamba around 8pm. There are a couple terminals in the small mountain city and the busses to Tena were at a different one. We caught a cab to the Terminal Oriental (Jungle Terminal), the two bus companies were closed and there were no more busses for the night. In addition, the city block had lost all power, so it was pitch black minus the lights from candles and cars. The taxi driver recommended we go to another area to get a hotel. We quickly agreed and drove to another area that did have electricity and found ourselves a place to stay.
Having not really had a chance to eat, we went in search of food. We walked around for about 5 minutes until we found a street full of street vendors. These vendors sell food right out of a small shack, but still have tables and seats to sit on. We were able to eat a delicious meal for less than 5$, combined. Not only delicious, but economical! We topped off our meal with gelato. After food, we returned to the hotel and called it a day.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dec 14 - Into the Amazon</title>

<em>Down the rabbit hole</em></p>
Liz and I were up early in the morning such that we could catch an early morning bus to Tena. We were on the bus and out the terminal by 7am. The bus ride itself was mostly uneventful, but the scenery was once again beautiful. As we slowly descended into the Jungle, or the Oriente or Selva as the Ecuadorians call it, the surrounding green became even more permeating. Just to give perspective, about half of the country is Amazon rainforest, but most of the forest is inaccessible. There are still undiscovered tribes that live in the deeper parts of the forest. And in case you are wondering, they donât want to be discovered, because they kill anyone that stumbles upon them. If you would like more information, I highly watching Survivor Manâs episode on the Amazon rainforest (he goes to Ecuador for it) and almost gets eaten by a Jaguar.

A little before lunchtime we pulled into Tena where we were greeted with a blast of humidity. I immediately began to sweat and within about 5 minutes my shirt was soaked. It did not help that I had to carry my backpack to the hostel, about 1km away. I should elaborate on the reason we chose to come to Tena. It is renowned for world class rafting. It is surrounded by a smattering of rivers of varying difficulty which allow any adventurer the level of difficulty they desire. After getting a place to stay, a place called âA Welcome Breakâ, which was quite clean and very cheap, we meandered around the town. The town itself is quite small and can be walked very fast, which made the overall meandering quite short.

We did however investigate rafting companies and jungle tours. We arranged a rafting tour with a company called <a href="http://www.riverpeoplerafting.com/">River People</a>. They were not the cheapest, but they were the most talked about. In addition, when choosing to do something like rafting, I am not against paying a bit more to ensure my safety. For instance, our hostal was offering rafting trips for about 25$ less, but his raft looked like something I would buy at Walmart. We booked a Class IV river called the Jondachi-Hollin (pronounced Hondachi-Hoyin).

After booking the rafting, we scoured the town (all few blocks) for a good deal on jungle tours. Unfortunately, to get the full force of the Amazon, one has to venture about 8 hours by bus to a place called Limoncocha. Since Liz and I did not have sufficient time for that, we opted for a one-day tour that would introduce us to the plants and basics of the jungle. (Iâll put in a quick review on the tour in the Dec 16 post).

When we had finished arranging everything, we decided that we needed to go for a swim in the river that ran through town, but wanted to see the zoo first. According to the guide book, there was supposed to be an animal sanctuary in the middle of the river. However, we could not find the bridge that was supposed to be link the island to the bank of the river. Since the water was only about 50ft across and about knee-deep, we simply waded across to the island. Once we scrambled up the banks, we were greeted by a very weird sight. Instead of there being an animal sanctuary, it was only a small smattering of animals walking around freely, with some in cages. We were quite confounded, since it was supposed to be a very well-established mini-zoo. Rather there were monkeys swinging through the trees, a ant-eater like animal walking around, and a few other animals in cages.

The most interesting animal though was a monkey, called Daniel, in a cage. When you got close, he would reach out his tail and his hand through the bars to touch you. His tail was extremely strong and could curl forcibly around your finger. It turns out that Daniel had gotten too aggressive and had to be put in the cage to protect people and the other animals. After walking around the small island, and seeing that most things were overgrown and unkempt, we were very confused as to why the guide book had talked about the place with such gusto. We found out from some other people at the hostal that there had been a flood in April of that year which had essentially wiped out most of the animals. The remaining ones were simply the survivors. This also explained the lack of a bridge, because that had been washed away.

After our "animal safari", Liz and I walked to the swimming part of the river and spent a good amount of time cooling off. The cool water was a welcome respite after all the humidity. When we thought we were sufficiently cool, we returned to the hostal, changed into dry clothes, and went out to find dinner. As for dinner we decided to make food, if only so that we could eat vegetables. Despite the street meat (my term for the vendors) being delicious, they donât serve vegetables. So while it would be cheaper to eat out, we opted to cook so that we could eat some veggies. After dinner we chatted with some of the other people at the hostal and called in an early night in anticipation of rafting the next day.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Jondachi-Hollin</em></p>
Today Liz and I were up earlyish and at the rafting place by 830am. The four other guys we would be sharing the day with showed up. They were a happy group made up of 3 people from LA and 1 from the Galapagos, all family. Soon after our guide and safety kayaker showed up and we were all piling in the van for the 25 minute drive to the river. The van could only drop us off close to the river though, and after that we had to walk about 30 minutes down a muddy (emphasis on muddy) track to get to the put-in point.

Once at the river, which due to rain the night before was running fast and big, we got our safety talk. After the talk we clambered into the raft and were off. The first part of the day (until lunch) was spent on mostly class III rapids, which while not large were continuous and great fun. The rain had made the level just perfect, not too fast and big, but not too slow and small. The river itself runs through a canyon for the first part of the morning. The scenery is amazing. The green-covered walls stretch up high above you, with butterflies, birds, and other animals swirling about you.

By lunchtime, everyone was starving, and we ended up eating all the food that had been brought along for lunch. This even included chocolate cake. After lunch came the class IV rapids. This meant bigger waves and faster water. It was awesome! We had the chance to ride on the front of the raft like cowboys. We were able to jump off and float through a few rapids. We stopped at some waterfalls and were able to jump off a cliff into the water. All in all, a great section of river.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and so did our day of rafting. The ride back saw most of us pass out from all the adrenaline we had had during the day. Once back in town, we said our goodbyes and headed off our separate ways. Liz and I topped our the day with a healthy-serving of street meat from the vendors.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Amazon Jungle by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5276794331/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5082/5276794331_8eb5a1ee79_z.jpg" alt="Amazon Jungle" width="640" height="458" /></a>
<em>Amazon Jungle as seen from the top of a tree</em></p>
Today was our jungle tour. Liz and I were at the office at 7am, but had to wait until 720am for the people to actually show up (even though they had said 7). After getting our rubber boots, we shuffled into a guyâs truck and began the 30 minute drive out to their reserve. We were dropped off at some buildings close off the road where we were given tea, while the guy chauffeuring us had breakfast. Up until this point, we thought this guy, Fausto was our guide. So when we began walking back into the forest on a paved concrete walkway, and he wasnât saying anything or explaining anything, we began to get a bit suspicious.

After about 20 minutes we arrived at a cabana where we were introduced to our real guide. It turns out Fausto was merely dropping us off. We took in the sight of the forest and waited while the two guys got things in order. Fausto then explained that we would do a 3 hour walk with our guide, then we would eat lunch, rest a bit, and return to the road where we could catch a bus back to Tena. He informed us that we would have to pay for the bus, which was only 50 cents. At this point, I told Fausto that he was mistaken. The tour was all-inclusive, especially transportation. The fact he wanted to put us on a bus already pissed me off, but that he wanted us to pay was unacceptable. He said that he had paid for the truck to come out there. I told him that didnât matter, he was supposed to do that and that he would also pay for the bus back to town. By now Fausto, had in my mind, become a weasel. So of course he tried to play his comment off by saying that we had talked with the girl in the office and he couldnât know what she said, but that he would honor what she had promised. I told him good, glad he understood that.

After Faustoâs little theatrics we started our jungle tour. The path led off into the shrubbery where we were soon engulfed by heat, humidy, green, trees, and insects. Our guide explained the different use of the plants, different types of trees, the medicinal plants, the most common insects, pointed out large spiders and some birds, and topped things off by letting us climb up a 60 meter tree to see the jungle from above the canopy. The rickety rebar ladder was not that comforting, but the view was spectacular. As far as the eye could see, trees and green pervaded the vision. After the tree, we returned to the cabana for lunch.

<em>Rickety Ladder + High Tree = Good view</em></p>
After lunch we walked back along the concrete path to road and caught the bus back to Tena. The bus was a local bus, hence packed with people and bad music. It brought back memories of the busses in Peru for me. Once back in town, we returned to the hostal to shower off. The jungle had been brutally humid, and as such, had meant we had sweated almost non-stop.
While the jungle tour had been interesting, it had also been a bit disappointing. This had nothing to do with the plants and insects we saw, but more to do with the company. Like most things, what they had said and what they had done, had been two different things. Fausto had been disingenuous and lied, and only when I confronted him and told him to his face what he would do, did he do it. For this reason, I do not recommend their company, MundoPuma. They were unprofessional and untrustworthy, and for this reason I recommend searching for another company.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dec 17 - On to Quito</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Liz and I were up early and on a bus by 630am to head to Quito. Before we had got on the bus though, I had bought some rice pudding (at least it is kind of like that with larger rice kernels) from a guy rolling it around on his cart. I had listened to another person try to buy some and had gotten the price before I approached. When I asked him how much it was, he quoted me a price 20 cents higher. I promptly said he was wrong and the other lady had just paid 50 cents. Caught in his lie, he just smiled and said âOk, no problemsâ and I replied âThatâs right, no problemsâ. I include this small story more as an example for how vendors (be them street or in a store), continually try to hike prices on me (or other westerners). While I know that I could fully pay the extra 20 cents, and it wouldnât make that much difference, it is the principle of the matter. I am just lucky I can speak Spanish to recognize when they are trying to rip me off. 

The bus ride itself was mostly passed in a sleepy stupor as Liz and I dozed for most of the 5 hours. We periodically awoke, took in the beautiful sight of the surrounding greenery, then fell back asleep. Once in Quito, the capital of Ecuador and a bustling metropolis, we decided to give the public transportation a try. Since using the Trolle (a bus with its own lane) costs only 25 cents, while a taxi would have been 10 dollars or up, it was a fairly easy decision. The bus itself was in great condition and getting to the part of town we needed to be in proved to be quick and painless. From the terminal we walked to our hostal, stopping along the way for lunch. 

After checking in to the hostal, we had decided we wanted to venture to a museum about 10 blocks away. However, after about 2 blocks, we were met with a huge and heavy downpour. We ducked into a cafÃ© to try and dry off and wait out the rain. Well, we waited, and waited, and the rain did not stop. So instead of trying to slog it down to the museum, we simply returned to the hostal to change into dry clothes and get warm. Since the heavy downpour did not abate all afternoon, and we did not have any more clothes to spare, we stayed at the hostal to watch some movies and stay warm in bed. We only got out at one point to make dinner, but then quickly retreated back to the warmth of the blankets. While we didnât get to see too much of Quito, we did catch up on some movies. We only hoped that the next day would see a stop to the rain and allow us to venture out a bit easier.

<h1>Background</h1>
A quick explanation: OLPC or One Laptop Per Child is a non-profit organization started out of MIT and run out of Cambridge. They built a unique laptop that is low in cost and runs off a derivative of Linux. This laptop is aimed for children in developing countries to help provide them cheap education and a way to connect with the greater world.

Last fall semester while I was still a student at UC Berkeley, we were visited by a group of people from OLPC. They described their program in detail. They also mentioned a new contingent of the company that was funding interns to work in deployment countries. I had a friend there that had coincidentally done this the summer prior (â09) and had described the experience as âawesomeâ. Thinking this was a chance to travel and provide community-service, I jumped at the chance. Fast forward to April, when all the interns were notified of their selection. We were given two time options, a two-month period over the summer months or three months in the fall. I choose to do the fall section, allowing myself time to work over the summer and prepare for my time in Peru. Soon enough the end of summer had arrived and I was on my way.

<em>What I got myself into</em></p>
I had hoped that the interns over the summer would have been able to provide some context for the situation we might encounter. All I really knew was how to use the laptop and that they had worked in a town called Huaraz. One of the previous interns had kept a blog, but it was brief. It focused more Spainâs prospects in the world cup rather than the actual work being done. Over a period of 1.5 months, it only had 13 posts. Another intern kept a blog that I was able to find in the last week of our time in Peru, but it too had little information on the actual work being done. It focused more on her lifestyle and less on the work being done. Therefore, I had almost no idea of the actual work the interns were doing. We were assured that we would have all questions answered by the Ministry once in Peru. Essentially, the other interns Hope and Josh, and myself knew almost nothing about what we were getting ourselves into, but were excited for the opportunity.

The interns over the summer had been subject to a week of training at the ministry of education in preparation for their jobs. We had been provided âtrainingâ over the summer by our volunteer supervisor. These trainings had consisted of long periods of time talking about laptop basics (i.e. taking a picture, pasting it into the write activity) via internet chat. Apparently, the interns over the summer had been much less technical savvy, and he was under impression that the fall group was the same. This was not the case. Two of us are engineers and the other a very savvy philosophy major. Over the summer there had been two engineers and ten teaching interns. The type of training we required was quite different. We probably would have been better served by discussing the teaching being done in the classes. At no point was the actual lesson plans being used in the class rooms discussed. Rather we discussed abstract concepts like the purpose of the laptop (a tool to help kids learn). While knowing the basics of the laptop functions is nice, it would have been preferable to learn ways to implement the laptops in the classroom.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Help by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5083991311/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4146/5083991311_ca8654cc5d_z.jpg" alt="Help" width="518" height="345" /></a>
<em>Helping the students</em></p>
Due to our âtrainingâ over the summer, we were to only have one day of training at the ministry. Therefore upon our arrival at the ministry, we assumed that we would be trained in how to implement the laptops with the class. However, for the whole first half of the day we spent the time with two different ladies. They continually talked about how our job was to convince the teachers to use the laptops. We were to be creative in figuring out ways to make the teachers utilize the laptops, because as we were told many did not want to. The other topic they discussed was how proud they were of their indigenous population. While this is a noble topic, it had almost no bearing on teaching with the laptop. The only teaching parts we discussed were how to make books in eToys and how to connect to each otherâs laptops using the mesh network.

The major positive part of our training was we were given a copy of the Peru software image, which is needed to flash the machines. Apparently flashing the machines is the only method of fixing any problems related to the software and any hardware problems should just be reported. Along with this software image we were also shown how to change the name and colors of the little XO person for the laptops. While you would think this should be easy, it is not. Rather one has to open up the terminal activity and manually enter a series of English commands. Not only is use of the terminal out of any teacherâs technical grasp, but so is English commands, even ones that are copied.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Concept Maps by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5084589796/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5084589796_40c0ab6e8f_z.jpg" alt="Concept Maps" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Concept Maps</em></p>
To avoid having laptops stolen, each laptop is activated using a key that lasts for the duration of the year. This key is included in the software image and part of the flashing process. While in theory this key should kick in and work fine, the laptopsâ internal clocks often get out of sync. This means the laptop thinks it is Feb 2008 or some other random date, rather than the current date. This causes the laptop to shut down and no longer allow functioning, rendering the machine useless.

Essentially the key points of our jobs would be to convince teachers to use the laptops and to be glorified laptop software flashers. When OLPC originally described this job, I was supposed to be installing Servers and SatLinks to provide Internet to schools, fixing software bugs, or replacing broken hardware parts. It was turning out that my job was going to be much different than originally promised.

Our bus trip to Huaraz, which was long and somewhat uneventful, can be revisited at <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2010/09/09/day-6-nine-hours-in-a-bus-from-lima-to-huaraz/">this post</a>.  The next day we met with the Ancash laptop specialist, who would be directing us where to go for our time in Huaraz. He informed Hope and Josh they would be spending two weeks at a time in one school, while I would be traveling to many schools and working for two days at time. At this point he handed us handwritten maps with approximate walking times and travel times between schools. The numbers at first were staggering and as I would come to find out, the reality, even more so.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Capistrano by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5106739161/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1175/5106739161_41b9d3c476_z.jpg" alt="Capistrano" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Ancash Specialist</em></p>
As I began to visit schools, I slowly became more familiar with the laptop and its limitations. Most of the workshops the Ministry had suggested I discarded because they were cumbersome and unrealistic. The reality of most schools was they only had a basic knowledge of how to operate the laptops. Additionally, the mouse pads, besides having a terrible design, often became so dirty that they stopped functioning. The most disturbing fact we discovered though was the software image being used was over two years old. While this doesnât necessarily have to be a cause of problems, it is when the software never gets updated and bugs never get fixed.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Utter Concentration by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5125502175/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1246/5125502175_20c1547d66_z.jpg" alt="Utter Concentration" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Concentration</em></p>
Peru had designed its own software image of Sugar, the XO operating system. A good way to think of Sugar and the image would be like a horse and donkey. They are somewhat similar but still different enough that they are separate animals. When Peru created their own software image they essentially cut themselves off from all the assistance provided to updating Sugar out of Sugar Labs. What this really means is the continual bug updates and other fixes being pushed to the normal Sugar image from the labs (think windowâs updates or mac software updates), would never reach the Peru image, until the updates had been customized for the Peru image. This creates a huge time-lag and bottleneck.

A majority of the programs have some serious issues that have not been fixed since their initial deployment. No follow-up is performed to solve problems. What is worse, is that many students and teachers cannot understand when problems occur and why they are occurring. They only understand that something is not working and get extremely frustrated. This usually causes them to abandon using the programs and also lose confidence in the laptop. To give one an idea of the severity of the issues, it took Hope, Josh, and me the course of a few months to discover a variety of errors and minor solutions to get the programs to function as intended.

<h1>Software is Only Half the Problem</h1>
While a myriad of software issues plague the laptop, they are accompanied by some equally problematic hardware issues. The first and most problematic problem is the touchpad. For some laptops, the touchpad simply does not function correctly. While trying to move the pointer around, the pointer will jump from one side of the screen to the other, without rhyme or reason. The children will often yell the words âNo sirveâ or âSe correâ in frustration.  Translated it means, âIt doesnât workâ and âItâs (the pointer) running aroundâ. The touchpad problem is exacerbated by the fact that the children rarely bathe and have extremely dirty hands. This causes the touchpads to become very dirty and work even less. One can provide a soft reset of the touchpad using a series of combinations on the keyboard, but it rarely fixes the problem.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Click the mouse! by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5125501111/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1404/5125501111_0e5db12879_z.jpg" alt="Click the mouse!" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Click the mouse!</em></p>
The keyboards are also a big problem. They are built with rubber and are of cheap quality. Therefore, the kids quickly rip keys and have to replace them with tape and draw the letter in.  In addition, actually trying to convey the idea of modifier keys beyond the use of shift and the accent mark, is almost impossible. If you show them one letter and explain that this works for all keys on the keyboard, they will not understand. Some might say this is my fault for not being able to teach them, but really it is more than that. Showing the kids one idea and trying to explain how to extrapolate this to other ideas, just doesnât work. Itâs just not how the kids are taught to learn. They are not encouraged to think outside the box (a phrase which translates but holds no meaning) and problem solve. The teaching method used by the teachers is call and response or copying things from the board. Kids do not work in groups or independently to exercise critical thinking, but rather will only repeat or copy what is given to them by the teacher.

<h1>Who needs training? Just put the laptops out there and amazing things will happen.</h1>
After about a month and a half, we had pretty much found all the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Y31Zm3Wj1BHhFUhKxbJldKZ6KcplVQzuWnz6-zRYMbc">software problems</a> and come to grips with the hardware ones. However, one problem still remained: the issue of teacher training. Peruvian teachers break down into two groups, those trying to get accredited and accepted as full-time teachers, they work on contracts that last a couple years, and those that are accredited and pretty much set with a job for as long as they want. Those who are contracted tend to be younger and more accepting of technology. The other ones tend to be older, 45 years plus, and have almost no experience with technology.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Help by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5176436924/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5176436924_18194fac60_z.jpg" alt="Help" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Younger Teacher</em></p>
The younger ones tend to catch on very fast and grasp the concepts quite fast. Even if they did not know where to start, once shown they caught on fast. They were also incentivized to do better, because they wanted to get hired permanently. The unfortunate part is that these teachers really only make up about 10% of the teachers I encountered. The other group, the older ones, tended to be much more difficult to teach. Disregarding their lack of experience with technology, they also simply did not have basic training in certain topics. This consisted of not knowing basic geometry, mathematics, or other topics. The technology issue was simply compounded by the inadequate education. The main idea here is that if the teachers were going to be able to use these laptops, they needed some serious training. The sad part is that there are tons of resources online, but most teachers do not know how to use the internet to access them. Most teachers do not even have email addresses, let alone the ability to search through google to find ideas on how to utilize the laptops. Internet access itself was non-existent in the villages, but they did have access to it in Huaraz. The opportunity was there, but the knowledge of how to take advantage of it was not.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="So hard by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5172682624/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5172682624_1d8fc09a66_z.jpg" alt="So hard" width="512" height="286" /></a>
<em>Thinking Hard</em></p>
Around this point, an <a href="http://edutechdebate.org/olpc-in-south-america/olpc-in-peru-one-laptop-per-child-problems/">article</a> came out describing some of the issues with the Peruvian OLPC deployment (<a href="http://edutechdebate.org/olpc-in-south-america/olpc-in-peru-one-laptop-per-child-problems/">read the article</a>). In it many issues are discussed, but beyond the issues, it is the response by Oscar Barreto that is disconcerting. He replies in the comments over 15 times, trying to discredit the article and draw attention to how the program is working. In fact, in his responses, he sadly only confirms one thing: the ministry has no idea how to make the program work. My favorite response was that if you just put the laptops out there in schools, and allow kids to play with them, then they will learn to utilize the machines and great things will happen (I cannot document this comment because it appears to have been deleted, but I guarantee it existed.).  Based on my experience, this is completely wrong. The only thing that happens is the laptops get opened, turned on, kids and teachers get frustrated by hardware and software bugs, donât understand what to do, and promptly box them up to put back in the corner.

**Nicholas Negroponte, the head CEO of OLPC, claims the same thing in <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/people/negroponte/new_negropontism_you_can_give_kids_xo_laptops.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OneLaptopPerChildNews+%28One+Laptop+Per+Child+News%29">this article</a>**
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Can I help you? by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5172083265/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/5172083265_c679699772_z.jpg" alt="Can I help you?" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>She's not impressed</em></p>
It appears that Mr. Barreto has not used the laptops, because when he claims âAre you purposefully ignoring the laptops come loaded with hundreds of reading texts, a 30,000 entries Spanish Wikipedia and several other things that just by themselves mean a quantum leap compared to what teachers and students had available before?â, it belies a simple knowledge about the machine. The Peru image has almost no books and any books on the machine have to be accessed via the browser activity. While Wikipedia is a great resource for information, it is not a book. The âbooksâ are simply pages of html text. Html text will never engage a child like a book does.

The ministryâs response to the article simply drew attention to one important fact: they did not want to hear criticism, even if it was constructive. They only wanted to hear that things were going great. To me, this really only said one thing: They did not care about the kids learning, but only about appearing to be doing something for the indigenous people. If people asked the administration, what are you doing to help the native people, they can say how theyâve given them laptops. They donât have to say that they donât train the teachers and that the laptops donât get used by the kids.

The problem with the ministry is compounded by politics as well. Since the program was inherited from a prior administration, and when administrations change so do all the people in the agencies, nobody had a good idea of what they should be doing. This problem will repeat with the next change of administration. Rather, the current administration expanded the program without addressing the issues. More or less, they did this to garner more votes for the next election by allowing them to say theyâre supporting education. Instead of doing the hard thing of providing training and follow-up, they just put laptops out in the field, and disappear. They cite geography more than anything else, as the barrier that keeps them from following up. Well, after having spent time walking between schools, I understand the issue of geography, but it is not insurmountable. In fact, a person equipped with a truck could access almost all the schools.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Teacher becomes the student by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5148333279/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5148333279_a4f3c64fe4_z.jpg" alt="Teacher becomes the student" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Teacher becomes the student</em></p>
After this series of events, one thing was for sure, the teachers were not going to get the help they needed from the ministry. The ministry was only good for lip service. They were in Lima, talking about the things that were happening, rather than in the field making it happen.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is part 6 of a 6 part series that critically examines my experience in Peru and the situation I encountered.

<a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2011/01/01/part-1-whoâs-to-blame-why-the-olpc-plan-in-peru-is-failing-and-who-is-causing-it/">Part 1</a> |Â <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2011/01/02/part-2-whoâs-to-blame-why-the-olpc-plan-in-peru-is-failing-and-who-is-causing-it/">Part 2</a> |Â <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2011/01/03/part-3-whoâs-to-blame-why-the-olpc-plan-in-peru-is-failing-and-who-is-causing-it-2/">Part 3</a> |Â <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2011/01/04/part-4-whoâs-to-blame-why-the-olpc-plan-in-peru-is-failing-and-who-is-causing-it/">Part 4</a> |Â <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2011/01/05/part-5-whoâs-to-blame-why-the-olpc-plan-in-peru-is-failing-and-who-is-causing-it/">Part 5</a> |Â <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2011/01/06/part-6-whoâs-to-blame-why-the-olpc-plan-in-peru-is-failing-and-who-is-causing-it/">Part 6</a>

<em><strong>Note</strong>: I am a graduated engineer that has been taught to think through problems and search for solutions. I am not an expert on Peru and I do not pretend to be. I am drawing on my own experiences and interpretations. My observations span twenty schools and countless interactions with the ministry and teachers over a period of approximately three months. In addition, I often refer to Hope and Josh, but I do not speak for their opinions.</em>
<h1>So, what is the problem and how can we fix it?</h1>
After all this I hope that it has become clear, that there isnât just one problem, but a series of problems. OLPC built a laptop that doesnât work well and has many problems. The Peruvian ministry of education has software that is too buggy and an infrastructure not built to support the deployment. Teachers do not have the training and sadly, the ability to change their situation.

So how do you make the deployment work with what is already there?
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Dios Mio! by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5125400163/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1309/5125400163_effe485924_z.jpg" alt="Dios Mio!" width="340" height="512" /></a>
<em>Dios Mio!</em></p>
<strong>First,</strong> fix the software and hardware bugs. The good news is that this is being undertaken by a couple of people in the ministry. The bad news is that even with this update, it will still be years behind the current Sugar release available from the Sugar labs. Deployment and update on the old machines will also be extremely hard, despite the ministryâs assertion that it will be done by next march (they themselves say geography is an issue). Hardware-wise any schools that get new laptops will have machines that have much better functioning mouse pads, but any schools with the original machines, will still suffer from the hardware problems.

<strong>Second</strong>, train the teachers and follow-up. Many of the teachers could grasp the concepts and how to use the machines, if only provided with the right training. This means, one-on-one training in their school where they are comfortable and relaxed. Calling all the teachers to Huaraz for a big workshop for one day, accomplishes almost nothing. The teachers do not learn well in groups, but need help one-by-one. We saw both systems tried, and without a doubt workshops do not work, but one-on-one instruction does. Equally important is follow-up. Going back to the teachers, asking them about the problems theyâre having, and working towards solutions. The teachers are the people working with the laptops day-in and day-out, they know what needs to change and be fixed.

<strong>Third,</strong> stop making excuses and do the hard work. People sitting in Lima talking about the problems that stand in the way, like geography, will not help anybody. Building a system that can train and support the deployment takes people in the field, and that is where the ministry should be deploying resources. The sad thing is that while that will help the children, it wonât change the politic picture. Putting people out in the country-side, wonât get more votes, so it wonât happen.
So who is to blame through all this?
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Yes? by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5182552967/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1282/5182552967_fdc9533cb4_z.jpg" alt="Yes?" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Why don't you tell me?</em></p>
The truth is that almost everybody is to blame. Everybody has messed up on some level. OLPC, the ministry, the interns, everyone has in some way made mistakes that have created a deployment that doesnât accomplish its fundamental goal, helping kids change their lives for the better. Does this mean that there arenât success stories? No, there are success stories, but they are few and the reality is not the success stories. And it is irresponsible and naÃ¯ve to tout a few stories as proof that the program is working.

After this whole article, I donât want you to think that I am only complaining. What I am trying to do is bring attention to the issues and problems that face the program, to realistically open the eyes of the public to what the situation is like on the ground. I hope that after this, the program can be approached more realistically. Honestly, what I really want is to see the kids have the ability to change their situations using machines like the laptops. I think most people do. But, acknowledging the reality of the situation and then figuring out how to make things works is much better than just making excuses and not really fixing the problem.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Sunset by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5126012972/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1119/5126012972_a7a0e40442_z.jpg" alt="Sunset" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Who?</em></p>
A person doing a phD has a similar <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/peru/reflections_on_4_months_of_observing_una_laptop_por_nino.html">article</a> on their experience.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Liz and I have been at the small beach town of Canoa on the Ecuadorian coast the past few days. Its rained a lot, sunned a lot, and generally been peaceful. The surf has been too small to surf, but wading is quite easy. My only complaint is there is no street meat to munch on. Tomorrow we will be busing back to Guayaquil to catch a plane back to Lima. Then from Lima its on our way home.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight I will fly out from Lima and be back in LA around 9am (with a routing through Dallas). I've been in South America since September 3rd. I've explored the Cordillera Negra, mostly by foot. I've enhanced by spanish ability past bumbling idiot to stumbling oaf. I've gotten stomach sickness, altitude sickness, and sometimes just felt crummy. I've taken night buses where I froze and day buses where I roasted. I've lost a water bottle, headlamp, jacket, sandals, and almost lost my hat. I've eaten guinea pig (not that bad) and had more than my fair share of rice and potatoes. I've been a volunteer and a tourist, but always a gringo. It's been a life-changing experience for me. I will NOT be the same after this. But the <strong>only thing I want for christmas,</strong> is to be home.

I will be releasing my official review of my time in peru and the OLPC program there over the course of the next week. It will be a series with a piece releasing every day. Make sure to come back tomorrow (6am if you're chipper) to start reading it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you check my blog somewhat regularly you will notice that I have switched themes. This biggest reason is that I am changing my site to be more in line with my current needs. I have started looking for a job and wanted a theme that would better suit my purposes. In addition to the theme change I will also be changing the structure and organization quite a bit as well. While the blog will still be quite prevalent, and I will continue to post things, I will be adding a bunch of things to the site based on project and work experience. So expect to see things moving around a LOT over the next few days.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are some serious hills in the San Francisco East Bay area. What this means for bikers is some great trails. After having searched for a while, I found the information regarding the two parks closest to me a bit lacking, and decided that I'd like to do a write-up to help provide some better information. The two parks I will talk about here are Joaquin Miller park and Redwood Regional. They are only separated by Skyline (the road).
<h2>Joaquin Miller</h2>
Joaquin Miller is a great little park maintained by the city of Oakland. It has a multitude of trails from single-track to the wider walking trails. It offers a great amount of variety for difficulty and fun. The best part about the park is it is right off of Highway 13 in Oakland.

A good trail: Parking can be found at multiple places around the park, however if you are looking to get right into the biking portion, I recommend Castle Dr. X Holyrood Dr. From there, take the trail going off to the left (not the one down the hill). Stay on this trail until you come to a small option to go off to the right, it will be right after the Bayview trail will go off to the left. After only a few moments you will get to the cinderella trail on your right. This is by far the best single track in the park. Go down cinderella! It is full of jumps, twists, and turns. From there you have two options for riding back up the hill - left at the bottom: circling back around on the Sunset Trail to the Sequoia Bayview Trail and ride that all the way up, veer left at the top of it; right at the bottom - Sunset Trail back to Castle Drive and up to castle drive until the road starts to bend left, there will be a super steep driveway, go up that and then on the right is Westview Trail, take that up to the top and then ride along the road for about 200ft and you'll be back at your start. There are other trails in the park that can be explored as well, but many are off-limits to bicyclists.

As always, be very friendly to pedestrians.

<a href="http://www.oaklandnet.com/JoaquinMillerPark/">Learn more on their official website</a> or download a <a href="http://www.oaklandnet.com/JoaquinMillerPark/images/JMMap.jpg">Trail Map</a>
<h2>Redwood Regional</h2>
Redwood Regional is much larger than Joaquin Miller and boasts many more options. The only trails where bicyclists are permitted are the ones that ring the park. These are the West and East ridge trails. There are multiple signs posted that threaten severe fines for mountain bikers that veer from those paths. The overall loop is probably about 8 hours. At the south end of the loop you drop down into the valley which is a great ride, whichever side you go down, but the ride up is definitely a butt-kicker. Make sure you have enough water, because it can get pretty warm there during the day.

		<title>ZipList - A grocery management system</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I had to figure out a solution to deal with groceries. I have a few roommates and coordinating the grocery shopping can get a little hectic. Making sure two people don't buy the same things or that nobody gets things, can be a big problem! Trust me, hungry people are not happy people :)

So, after hearing the "we SHOULD figure out a better way to do things," I mentioned that we could probably find an application that would allow us to use our phones to solve our grocery woes. I searched around a bit and found a great post on life hacker (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5479742/ziplist-is-an-impressive-grocery-list-tool-with-coordinated-shopping-anywhere-access">view post</a>) about an application called ZipList. Luckily Ziplist proved to be the perfect solution.

Ziplist allows us to use our smartphones (Android and iPhone) to keep a common grocery list synced among four people. In addition, its got a recipe feature that allows you to add a recipe to your account and then automatically import those ingredients into the grocery list. They have another feature that is pretty cool, although not too well implemented yet, that allows you to add the stores that you normally visit and organize the store aisles. What this means is you can have your list automatically lay itself out according to aisle to streamline what you pickup and where. The only problem is you have to do the layout by hand the first time, which is somewhat of a pain.

Ziplist has a website and apps for Android and iPhone which makes it a near-perfect fit for grocery shopping.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dropbox and using it as an automatic version history</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First off, sorry for the lack of posts. I plan on trying to get back into a more regular flow. It has been difficult because I've been searching for a job (more info on that in later posts) and focusing on doing CODING PROBLEMS.  Anyways, I first off apologize for the lack of posts and hope to make it up with something useful here. 

<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/static/15327/images/logo.png" alt="dropbox" />

While many people use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, there are still a lot who don't, and sadly, a lot of people who don't realize how useful it can be. I should explain that Dropbox is a free online storage company that allows you to have a built-in folder to your computer that automatically syncs to the cloud and any other computer you have Dropbox installed on (literally drag-n-drop functionality). My main reason for this post is to describe the version history feature that can be an <strong>absolute life saver</strong>. 

Version history, in its most simplest terms, is a way to keep track of something as you change it. So say you have a word document, everytime you save it, you overwrite the previous state, but with a version history, you will actually be saving a new state. What do this really mean? Let's say you mess something up, or just want to go back to a prior version of a document, getting there could be a real pain (how many times can I press undo...). However, this is where Dropbox steps in. 

By having a document saved in your Dropbox folder, every time you save it, it actually gets reuploaded as a new version. Translation - AUTOMATIC File BACKUP. That is an amazing feature. Lets break that down into sections. 

AUTOMATIC - You don't have to think about it. This is a great thing. 

BACKUP - You have a copy forever accessible on the Dropbox website. This is a amazing thing. (Ever have a hard drive die? Life saver!)

So now instead of manually saving a file as File1 or File2 to determine versions, simply save it and you'll have a dated history snapshot of the file. And that my friends is amazing. 

If Dropbox sounds like something you'd like to use, simply click this link - <a href="http://db.tt/NvekR2h">http://db.tt/NvekR2h</a> - and sign-up. You'll help me out by giving me a bit more space (everytime you refer someone, you get more space) and you'll help yourself by not losing files anymore.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I ran into an old friend yesterday and as all post-college kids are prone to do, we started talking about what we are "doing with our lives". The sentence is probably the most feared and difficult one to answer. While I personally don't ever think that it is fully answered, you can at least figure out parts. Anyways, I digress.

While I was in Peru with <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/one-laptop-per-child/">OLPC</a> I got to meet a lot of travelers and learn about a lot of resources available. It really made me appreciate how much travel can make you grow and learn as a person. All the new experiences and interactions are on the whole positive and useful. Well, I got to talking with this friend and started to describe the traveling experience, and really saw him get excited. See, he is currently living at home with his parents, and while not a bad situation, definitely one he wants to change. When he said I just want to move out and have a little money saved, I recommend that he take that money and buy a plane ticket, and go. It was one of those statements where you see someone just totally absorb an idea and really consider it on the spot. One of the "I never thought of that, but it sounds really doable." It was awesome.

Since I gathered together such a nice list of resources while in Peru, I told him I would them to him. But as I was writing the email, I thought, this would make an awesome blog post. So compiled below is a list of websites, blog posts, and other resources that can really be used to find cheap places to go, cheap plane tickets, cheap places to stay, and all other sorts of goodies.

*** My last bit of advice is this: free advice is good, advice you pay for is better. Some of the sites might provide services that are minimal, but the potential advice that one can garner is going to be about 50X better than the free stuff they show. Just keep that in mind when deciding to pay.

** None of these sites asked me to do this. They are what I personally find useful. Keep that in mind.
<h3><strong>Nomadic Matt's Travel Site</strong></h3>
<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/">http://www.nomadicmatt.com/</a>

--&gt; Probably the best one for information. A must read. He has lots of links to other peoples site that might have more place specific information for you. (My friend Hope hates his writing style, but his content is great, so can't argue with that :P)
<h3><strong>The Art of Non-conformity</strong></h3>
<a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/">http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/</a>

--&gt; A must read for anyone. Even if you aren't doing travel. His books and posts are absolutely inspiring. Want to break out of the mundane and do something with your life? Tangibly? This is your man to help show you how.

**** His travel siteÂ <a href="http://travelhacking.org/">http://travelhacking.org/</a> could literally save you hundreds of dollars with ideas on how to get cheap tickets and travel on the cheap. Well worth the price to pay to get his advice if you're new to the travel game.

<h3><strong>TravelZoo</strong></h3>
<a href="http://www.travelzoo.com/">http://www.travelzoo.com/</a>

I would recommend that once you know where you want to go, go to the store, read some of the guide books on the places, see which ones you like, and purchase one of them. No more than one, remember you'll have to carry that weight :)]]></content:encoded>
