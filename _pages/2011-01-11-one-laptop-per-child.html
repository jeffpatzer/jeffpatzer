<div>During the fall of 2010 I spent three months as a volunteer intern in rural Perú. My main goal was to educate teachers and students about how to better use their XO laptops. I ended up learning as much from them as I think they did from me.</div>
While in Perú I developed a series of <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/olpc-workshops/">workshops</a> to be used while teaching the kids.

You can catch up on all the <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/category/olpc/">blog posts</a> that I wrote while there.

If you want a quick way to get an idea of what my experience was like, check out my final report. It is a six part series.
