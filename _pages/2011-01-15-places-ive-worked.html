I've worked at a variety of places in a variety of jobs. They've all taught me very different things :)
<h3>One Laptop Per Child</h3>
(<strong>Sep 2010 - Nov 2010</strong>) I spent 3 months in rural Perú as an intern helping to teach students and teachers how to better use their XO laptops. It was an amazing, life-changing experience. I blogged about the experience the entire time I was there. I highly recommend checking out my <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/one-laptop-per-child/">OLPC page</a> for pictures and blog posts.
<h3>Todoroo Inc.</h3>
(<strong>Febuary 2010 - Nov 2010</strong>) I did an externship with Todoroo over the winter break in early 2010 and ended up being hired to perform miscellaneous tasks for them about a month later. As a successful android application start-up, they were beginning to get over-whelmed by customer support, bug management, and other miscellaneous tasks. Essentially these things were taking up so much time, the team was not able to focus on other things. I stepped in to do their customer service, test parts of the application, do small bug tweaks, and a myriad of other tasks.  It was a great way to see the way a start-up works and functions, and work with a team of great guys. I recommend you check out their task app <a href="http://weloveastrid.com/">Astrid</a> and their life-coach app <a href="http://blog.todoroo.com/">Todoroo</a>.

<h3>Berkeley Energy &amp; Resources Collaborative</h3>
(<strong>Summer 2009 - Dec 2010</strong>) I worked with BERC mostly as a website consultant. I did projects for them to help them fix and enhance their website. I did a lot of media creation and site reorganization, including a theme update. As a energy group based out Haas, I helped them to migrate some of their technologies to leverage free alternatives and save them money. This included how they stored photos and videos, how they distributed their material, and how they integrated their mailing list systems.

<h3>Gender Equity Resource Center</h3>
(<strong>March 2008 - May 2010</strong>) I mostly stumbled upon this job, but it turned out to be one the best things to happen in college. My job while there was to be their web and technology intern, which meant that beyond maintaining the website I dealt with almost all tech related questions. While there I got to switch the website over from a old CMS (ektron? realllllyyyy old) to a new Drupal-based system. I designed a completely new and unique theme to help better capture the mission and culture of the center. In addition, I often spec'ed out technology requests. I helped the center purchase and integrate a projection system to be used for their workshops. I helped many of the interns figure out how to assemble their workshops and programs in Powerpoint, enhance their media through video and photography, and leverage those technologies to best serve them. In addition to all this, I also made some lasting friendships that helped to change the way I viewed the world in ways that I would never have anticipated.

<h3>Fit Staff</h3>
(<strong>Summer 2007 - Dec 2007</strong>) I worked with the Gym Fit Staff while carrying a full load of classes in college. I started during the summer and things lasted until the end of the year. It was a great place to work for an active person. I got to interact with many of the trainers, getting lots of their tips for free. It also really helped me to learn how to balance and manage my time.
<h3>Tyce Construction</h3>
(<strong>Fall 2003 - Summer 2006</strong>) I worked for Tyce Construction, a commercial construction firm, for three years. I was a laborer/all-around fix-it upper which mean that I worked on all sorts of projects. I got to do landscaping (digging ditches), framing, electrical, concrete, carpentry, lighting, drywall, and lots of other things. This was often done in the Poway summer heat (85+) which delighted my father to no end, something about building character. Eventually, I began to oversee some of the sub-contractors, making sure they were getting the job done and doing things correctly. Working on a construction site also let me practice my spanish, since many of the workers were often bilingual.
<h3>Military Daycare</h3>
(<strong>Summer 2003</strong>) I worked at the TriCare daycare for a summer after my freshman year of high school. I helped the staff with their typical duties, but also augmented things by playing with the kids at recess, in the pool, at the park, and any other place where they needed something to chase. It was a great opportunity to mature and learn how to deal with young children, who can be some of the most challenging and rewarding to work with.
<h3>Ice Selling &amp; Lawn Mowing Business</h3>
(<strong>1998-2002</strong>) When I was in grade school my brother and I started a business together. Since we lived in military housing in Hawaii, we were in a place where many husbands were gone on long deployments. What this meant is that the wives were left at home with no one to do a lot of the yard work. My brother and I stepped in to fill the void. We purchased some extra yard machines and tools to augment our current supply and using our go-cart pulled our machines from house to house. We ended up mowing about 60% of the yards in the 300 house complex. What made things especially good is that living in hawaii the weather always made sure the grass kept growing. In addition to yard work, we also sold ice. Our dad had purchased a commercial ice machine from a fisherman (for himself, he still has it), and my brother and I each helped to pay for some of it. Fitting a cooler into the back of the go-cart frame, we were able to drive around and deliver ice by the bag and by the cooler. We undercut the competition (7-eleven) by selling ice for half the price and with free delivery. Once again, the hawaiian climate helped us by always being about 80 degrees. The best part of both businesses though, is that once we were using our go-cart for more than just driving around for fun, the people in the neighborhood complaining about the go-cart could not complain as much, because now we were delivering their ice!
