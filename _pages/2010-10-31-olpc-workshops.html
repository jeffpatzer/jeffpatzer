  _aioseop_description: ! 'A list of workshops I''ve designed for the OLPC XO laptop.
    They are specific to the Peru Software Image. '
---
I've listed here the workshops that I tend to do with the kids. I try to utilize the activities that I think will be the most useful for the kids, which are usually one's they don't know how to use. Since I am working in Peru with the Peru image, these workshops are tailored for that system. Most workshops are designed to teach the kids and the teachers the capabilities of the system. 
<h3>Workshop 1: Wikipedia and Escribir</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Many schools only know about the opening page in Wikipedia. As well, they have no idea that pictures and text can be copied from Wikipedia and pasted into Escribir. The most important thing is that no schools know that you can search within Wikipedia for lots of articles. Since the Peru image has almost zero books loaded onto the system, Wikipedia is the best resource for learning about the outside world.</li>
	<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To learn about Wikipedia and how to search within the system. To learn how to copy text and pictures to the clipboard and paste them into Escribir. To realize that anything can be searched for.</li>
	<li><strong>Method:</strong> We begin by opening Wikipedia. I explain the first page, with the links, and how since the words are blue, that you can click them to go to articles. After this I explain that you can also search for whatever information you'd like in Wikipedia. We then use the Buscar tab to search for Peru, their country. This brings up the results, which we need to then sift through to find Peru, it is always the first word. We click on it and wait for it to load. The article then comes up and we read the first paragraph. I then make the kids scroll down to the Education section. We then highlight the whole section and copy the text using ctrl+c. I then explain how this puts the text in the clipboard. Then we switch to the home screen of the laptop.
At this point, we open up Escribir. I have them paste the text into the page using ctrl+v. Then we switch back to the home screen, and enter the already open Wikipedia. I then have them find the picture of Machu Pichu, which is back at the top of the article. We then copy the picture to the clipboard by clicking and dragging the photo to the corner, then depositing it in the clipboard. We then switch back to the home screen and re-enter the open Escribir. We then paste the photo from the clipboard by clicking and dragging the photo from the clipboard into Escribir. We then save Escribir with the name of Peru.
I then repeat this process using the futbol article. We copy and paste text and a photo.</li>
	<li><strong>Skills gained:</strong> How to search in Wikipedia. How to copy text and photos. How to paste text and photos. How to utilize and interact with the clipboard. How to switch between open activities. How to save an Escribir activity with a specific name.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Workshop 2: Escribir</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong>Many schools only know how to type text into Escribir. They do not have to utilize any of the more advanced features available in the system.</li>
	<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To teach students the more advanced features of Escribir. This includes changing the size of a font, changing a font, change the color of text, change the alignment of the text, undo, redo, inserting tables, navigating tables, changing the size of pictures, moving pictures around, and sharing the activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Method:</strong> To start, we open Escribir. We then type the text "Mis Nuevos Amigos". I then tell them, that if this is a title, then we want to make sure that the text is different. We then highlight (skill learned in Workshop 1) the text, I emphasize the importance of this, to be able to change the text. The first thing we do is change the text size, to something larger. Then we change the color of the text. To see the color change we have to unhighlight the text, which allows us to practice highlighting again. Then we change the font to PakTypeNaqsh, because its fancy looking and the kids love it. We then change the alignment to the middle of the page.
After all this we press enter a few times and change the alignment back to the left. We then type a sentence, the words are not important. But then I tell them that we want to undo this, because it is not what we want. To do this, we use the buttons "Deshacer" and "Rehacer" to undo and redo the sentence writing. I then have them practice this with the keyboard, with ctrl+v & ctrl+c.
After this we press enter a few more times, and switch to the Tabla tab. We then insert a 3x3 table. Then we type their first name in the first cell, their last name in the second cell, and their age in the third. We then repeat that info, but with the names and ages of friends in the next two rows. I make them use the arrow keys to navigate the table. 
After the table activity, we save the activity and quit Escribir. 
I then pair the students into groups, depending on the size of the class. I give them numbers. I then have on number open Escribir and share the activity. I have the other numbers go to the Neighborhood view, and look for the activity. I emphasize that they need to look at the XO person first, confirm its the right name, and then click on the icon. When the kids have joined up with their respective groups, I assign each number a sentence. They are to write the sentences one person at a time, to avoid confusion. After writing about three sentences each, I have them save the activity and quit the activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Skills gained:</strong>  How to change text size, color, alignment, and color. How to utilize undo and redo (with the keyboard and buttons). How to insert a table and navigate using the arrows. How to share the activity and write a escribir activity together.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Workshop 3: Memorizar</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Most schools know how to play this game, but don't know how to change the game type. They also don't know how to change the difficulty. Most importantly, they don't know how to create their own games. They also lack knowledge of how to share the application and play together.</li>
	<li><strong>Purpose:</strong>  To learn how to change the type and difficulty of the game. To learn how to create their own games and how to share the games to play together.</li>
	<li><strong>Method:</strong>  We first open Memorizar. I have them play one round of the game. This tends to be done quickly. Then we change the level of the game, and play another round of the game. This tends to take a bit more time. We then change the type of game and play another round. At this point the kids are having a great time, thinking they are playing a game, but really are learning a lot. I then tell the kids that we can make our own games to play whatever we want.
We go to the create tab and I explain the layout. I then query them for colors. We write down twelve colors and I translate them into english. We use this to create a game of colors. Once all the colors have been made into pairs, we save the game. Then we switch back to play and load the game. These previous two steps are very important and I emphasize them when we do them. I allow them to play another round of the game with their newly created set.
After this I have all of them quit Memorizar. I pair them into groups of two and give them numbers. I have one person open Memorizar and load their game. Then they have to share the activity. The other person then goes to the Neighborhood view, verifies the person by hovering over the XO man,and then clicks on the icon to join. Once they are loaded in the same game, I explain the idea of turns and allow them to play a couple of rounds. They love this because they are competing. After a few rounds I have them quit the activity and redo the process, but this time in switched positions, allowing each person to practice opening, sharing, and joining. They then play a few more rounds of the game.
We then create another game of animals with spanish/english. We repreat the playing procedure to reinforce concepts.</li>
	<li><strong>Skills gained: </strong>How to change the level. How to change the type of game. How to create, play, and share their own games. How to create games to practice things they learn in class.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Workshop 4: Scratch</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Most schools have no knowledge of this program. They only know it as the "cat" activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To teach the children how to open examples. How to start and stop examples. How to put the activity into presentation mode. How to create a script, utilizing various blocks to create more interactive engagement than is possible with TurtleArt.</li>
	<li><strong>Method:</strong> When first using turtle art, I will have the kids open the activity and we will first open a few examples. I usually use the animation examples, stepping them through the process of opening the activity, starting the activity, stopping the activity, and opening another example. After we've opened three or four, then we open a game example. The only two games that work well are Tetris and Pong, so usually we open these. I explain how to use the mouse or the arrows to play the game. I then give the kids some time to play the games. After a few rounds of the games we open a blank template to start our own project.
I explain that characters have scripts, which allow them to move, talk, and interact with the environment. The default character is the cat, so we first build a script for the cat. We build the script step-by-step, making the cat do each step as we build it. This helps to explain what the scripts do to the characters. For the cat, the first whole script is as follows: When Flag Pressed, think um..., say hello <name>, change costume color, put down pen, increase pen size, repeat walk forward, turn, say meow. This little script is a good introduction to what the kids can do with the scripts. The second script we build is a keyboard control script, which allows the cat to be controlled with the arrow keys. The script is simple: When flag is pressed, Always (if left arrow pressed -> move left by 5 paces) (if right arrow pressed -> move right by 5 paces). They kids find this impressive and love the idea they can build these scripts so easily. We practice saving our scripts within the correct folders and reopening other ones. Since Scratch does not tie into the Diary system, it takes a bit of getting used to.</li>
	<li><strong>Skills gained:</strong> How to open examples. How to start, stop, and open presentation view. How to think linearly (they are programming without knowing it). How to utilize the power of scratch. </li>
</ul>
