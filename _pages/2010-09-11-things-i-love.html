I like to really do my research about things I buy to use. In fact, I probably over-research most things. But, what does this mean, you get to benefit from my research! This will be a continually updated list :)

I think the first and most useful things for me to list are those sites that I find extremely useful and inspirational .
<ul>
	<li><strong>Stuck in Customs</strong>: The guy who runs this site is the absolute boss on HDR photography. Visit his site at <a href="http://www.stuckincustoms.com/">stuckincustoms.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>Abduzeedo</strong>: This is a great site for inspiration, photoshop tutorials, and lots of other design related businesses. Visit the site at <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/">abduzeedo.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>TechMeMe</strong>: This site is a great aggregation of the top tech news at the moment. Its a really efficient way to read through the best tech articles without spending too much time doing it. Visit the site at <a href="http://techmeme.com/">techmeme.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>XKCD.com</strong>: This site provides no real value beyond awesome nerd humor. They describe themselves as "A webcomic of Romance, Sarcasm, Math, and Language." Visit the site at <a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>Iwillteachyoutoberich</strong>: This is a personal finance blog written for 20-somethings. His advice is sound and his plans are extremely implementable. If you are just starting to learn about personal finance and managing your money, check this guy out. His book is definitely worth it. Visit his site at <a href="http://iwillteachyoutoberich.com/">iwillteachyoutoberich.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>Get Rich Slowly</strong>: This is a another great blog on personal finance. J.D. Roth knows his stuff and shares a lot of knowledge and tips. Visit his site at <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/">getrichslowly.org</a></li>
	<li><strong>Strobist</strong>: The one-stop shop for learning how to do flash work with a camera. Visit the site at <a href="http://www.strobist.blogspot.com/">strobist.blogspot.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>The Big Picture</strong>: A blog by the Boston Globe, this is the best place to look at pictures of world events. The pictures are the article. Visit the site at <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/">boston.com/bigpicture</a></li>
	<li><strong>The Consumerist</strong>: Hey, you buy things right? Why not use the internet to find out who's going to give you great service and whose going to screw you. Visit the site at <a href="http://consumerist.com/">consumerist.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>Back Country</strong>: This is probably the best store that I know of for buying things for outdoor activities. They are an online REI, but with awesome customer service. They have an unlimited return policy, that means you could use something for years and they'd take it back. I'm not saying do that, but they're that good. Visit their site at <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/"> backcountry.com</a></li>
	<li><strong>Amazon</strong>: This site has great prices and a ton of choices. What really makes it worth it is the Amazon Prime. Prime is two-day free shipping on just about every item. If you're a student you can get Prime for free :) Visit their site at <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a></li>
</ul>

Some of the gear that I have had in Peru that I have found to be the most useful and necessary are the following:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Petzl Headlamp</strong>: Really any model will do, mine is the Tikka plus. This has been by far the most useful thing in my pack. I use it almost every day. The batteries last forever, I haven't changed them in months. It's hands-free and super comfortable, you can wear it all day and not be bothered. If you don't have one, get one now. REI, Backcountry, or Amazon are good places to look.</li>
	<li><strong>Camelback Backpack</strong>: My pack is called the Helena, it's technically for women, but I got it on sale, and well it looks unisex, so it doesn't bug me. Plus, its now so dirty, that it could not be recongized as a women's pack. But, the reason its so helpful is that it can carry a ton, is super adjustable, comfortable, and has so many outside straps that I've used for all sorts of things its not intended for. It expands and compresses really nicely. I also use it for any adventure sports that I do. While I have a camelback, really any small pack with hydration capability (get the 3L size), is worth an investment.</li>
	<li><strong>Small pack bags</strong>: This could be a compression bag for your sleeping bag, or small bags for nic-nacs. Really, you can't have enough small bags to put things in. It makes organizing your pack and locating things easy. However, and this is more important, it helps to save you space, which is always good.</li>
	<li><strong>Icebreakers</strong>: This is a clothing line made of micro-wool that wicks sweat, is super-warm, super-lightweight, and can be used for weeks without washing because it doesn't pick up odors. While the clothing is expensive, one shirt is worth having 5 cotton ones. My favorite piece is a 1/4 zip that is a 200 weight. I wear it as a layer, to sleep in, and whenever else. It's the most useful piece of clothing I have.</li>
	<li><strong>Large metal mug</strong>: I don't have a cook kit with me, only this mug. It's big enough to cook in and works great for lots of stuff, like washing myself. Its much simpler than carrying around a official cookkit, which is great if you're on a budget. They only cost about 5$, although as a downside, they are a bit heavy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
Another site, that really needs its own section is, TED.com. This is the site for the TED conference, a great conglomeration of Tech, Education, Design, and to just about everything. They get great speakers to talk about subjects they're experts in, for under 20 minutes. It's just plain awesome. I've listed a few of my favorites below.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Jill Bolte Taylor's Stroke of Insight</strong>: <object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="446" height="326" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><param name="bgColor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="flashvars" value="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/JillBolteTaylor_2008-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/JillBolteTaylor-2008.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=229&amp;introDuration=15330&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=830&amp;adKeys=talk=jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight;year=2008;theme=medicine_without_borders;theme=master_storytellers;theme=top_10_tedtalks;theme=how_the_mind_works;event=TED2008;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" /><param name="src" value="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="446" height="326" src="http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf" flashvars="vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/JillBolteTaylor_2008-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/JillBolteTaylor-2008.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=229&amp;introDuration=15330&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=830&amp;adKeys=talk=jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight;year=2008;theme=medicine_without_borders;theme=master_storytellers;theme=top_10_tedtalks;theme=how_the_mind_works;event=TED2008;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;" bgcolor="#ffffff" wmode="transparent" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></li>
