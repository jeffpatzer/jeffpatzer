<strong>Instructor</strong>: Brian Barsky

I took this class in the Fall of 2009. It is an introductory course for animation. 

While in the class I learned to create hand-drawn animations, the theory behind animation, the importance of story-telling, to create computer-based animations, and how to combine various programs to create the final end product. The final products required a good deal of video and sound editing. 

Below are the works that I produced while in the class.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.jeffpatzer.com/animations/flipbook.mov">Assignment 1 - Flipbook (my segment)</a>: This assignment was a class assignment where each person drew a picture, copied it and then passed one to another person. This was done is a circle and everyone drew from their picture to the other picture. This created a circular flipbook that can bee seen below.</li>
