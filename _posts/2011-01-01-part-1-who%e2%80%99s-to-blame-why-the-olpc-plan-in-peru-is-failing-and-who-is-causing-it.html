This is part 1 of a 6 part series that critically examines my experience in Peru and the situation I encountered.

<em><strong>Note</strong>: I am a graduated engineer that has been taught to think through problems and search for solutions. I am not an expert on Peru and I do not pretend to be. I am drawing on my own experiences and interpretations. My observations span twenty schools and countless interactions with the ministry and teachers over a period of approximately three months. In addition, I often refer to Hope and Josh, but I do not speak for their opinions. </em>
<h1>Background</h1>
A quick explanation: OLPC or One Laptop Per Child is a non-profit organization started out of MIT and run out of Cambridge. They built a unique laptop that is low in cost and runs off a derivative of Linux. This laptop is aimed for children in developing countries to help provide them cheap education and a way to connect with the greater world.

Last fall semester while I was still a student at UC Berkeley, we were visited by a group of people from OLPC. They described their program in detail. They also mentioned a new contingent of the company that was funding interns to work in deployment countries. I had a friend there that had coincidentally done this the summer prior (’09) and had described the experience as “awesome”. Thinking this was a chance to travel and provide community-service, I jumped at the chance. Fast forward to April, when all the interns were notified of their selection. We were given two time options, a two-month period over the summer months or three months in the fall. I choose to do the fall section, allowing myself time to work over the summer and prepare for my time in Peru. Soon enough the end of summer had arrived and I was on my way.

<em>What I got myself into</em></p>
I had hoped that the interns over the summer would have been able to provide some context for the situation we might encounter. All I really knew was how to use the laptop and that they had worked in a town called Huaraz. One of the previous interns had kept a blog, but it was brief. It focused more Spain’s prospects in the world cup rather than the actual work being done. Over a period of 1.5 months, it only had 13 posts. Another intern kept a blog that I was able to find in the last week of our time in Peru, but it too had little information on the actual work being done. It focused more on her lifestyle and less on the work being done. Therefore, I had almost no idea of the actual work the interns were doing. We were assured that we would have all questions answered by the Ministry once in Peru. Essentially, the other interns Hope and Josh, and myself knew almost nothing about what we were getting ourselves into, but were excited for the opportunity.
