The second of our trek, Sunday the  28<sup>th</sup>, was supposed to be an early day. While some of the  group was up and ready at the 7am breakfast time, some were still sleeping.  However, as soon as the words banana pancakes were screamed, those still  asleep appeared instantly. After our hearty breakfast of pancakes and  tea, we suited up and were on the trail. Today we were to be walking  along the bottom of the canyon for about 2.5 hours to a town called  Oasis. If you are wondering does the name mean anything, then you would  be absolutely correct.

The hike itself was mostly flat. However,  there was a small climb that was really only bad due to the hot sun  hitting the face of the hill that we had to climb. The overall climb  really only took about 20 minutes at most, and after that it was downhill.  In fact, as we started going downhill, Oasis came into view. To fully  appreciate this site you have to imagine this: desolate canyon walls,  minimal water, hot sun, and in the distance a green patch spotted with  blue. What is the blue you might ask? Well, those are pools. Pools,  in the middle of the Peruvian countryside, wow. You know you are a tourist  when where you are going has a pool in the middle of nowhere. Nevertheless,  this caused everyone to pick up their pace and as we trickled into the  lodge area one-by-one we as quickly jumped into the pool.

After everyone had had a good dip and  was able to cool off a bit, we went back to the cards until lunch time.  At lunch time, no one hesitated to wolf down a large amount of pasta.  After a few hour walk during the day, everyone was absolutely famished.  Since Liz can no longer eat gluten, I got to have her portion of pasta.  To combat the post-lunch lull, we returned to our card game. Eventually,  the lodge was able to scrounge up a volleyball and the group played  about 2.5 hours of volleyball together. If I remember correctly, the  guy team won. However, some might debate you on that.

Unfortunately, after the end of the  volleyball game I began to have a serious headache. It was soon followed  by chills. I figured that I just needed to rest and take a nap. So I  took a nap and only woke up for dinner. However, I felt no appetite  whatsoever. I was only able to eat the soup. Following dinner, my stomach  began to hurt, along with my head, so I went to bed immediately after  eating. My night of sleep was terrible. My mind raced and I couldn’t  get any proper rest. The icing on the cake was our 430am wake up call  for the 5am departure and climb out of the canyon. I went to bed hoping  I would feel better by the time I woke up, but I was absolutely wrong.
