  _aioseop_description: My friends and I visited the Llanganuco Lakes via local transportation.
    It was a nice day and we were able to save quite a bit of money by doing it on
    our own rather than with a tour company.

Today Hosh and myself did a bit of touristing. We went to go see the Llanganuco Lakes at the foot of the largest mountain in the area Huascaran. Unfortunately the mountain was covered in clouds, so we couldn't really get any pictures of it. However, the lake was quite beautiful. It changes color throughout the year; it was green when we were there. To get there we opted to not do an organized tour from the many companies in Huaraz, but choose to take a combi to Yungay, the town below the lakes, and then a cab from there to the lakes. There are lots of combis from Huaraz to Yungay, about an hour, and lots of taxis hovering around to take you from Yungay to the Lakes, also about an hour. Overall it saved us about half of the cost of a trip through a tour agency. Plus this way we got to have the 'adventure' of local transportation. Overall it was a pretty relaxing day of tourismo (spanish term).

On another note, I saw the Cal football team got killed by U$C. Sigh.
