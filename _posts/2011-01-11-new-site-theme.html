If you check my blog somewhat regularly you will notice that I have switched themes. This biggest reason is that I am changing my site to be more in line with my current needs. I have started looking for a job and wanted a theme that would better suit my purposes. In addition to the theme change I will also be changing the structure and organization quite a bit as well. While the blog will still be quite prevalent, and I will continue to post things, I will be adding a bunch of things to the site based on project and work experience. So expect to see things moving around a LOT over the next few days.
