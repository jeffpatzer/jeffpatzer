Liz and I were up early and on a bus by 630am to head to Quito. Before we had got on the bus though, I had bought some rice pudding (at least it is kind of like that with larger rice kernels) from a guy rolling it around on his cart. I had listened to another person try to buy some and had gotten the price before I approached. When I asked him how much it was, he quoted me a price 20 cents higher. I promptly said he was wrong and the other lady had just paid 50 cents. Caught in his lie, he just smiled and said “Ok, no problems” and I replied “That’s right, no problems”. I include this small story more as an example for how vendors (be them street or in a store), continually try to hike prices on me (or other westerners). While I know that I could fully pay the extra 20 cents, and it wouldn’t make that much difference, it is the principle of the matter. I am just lucky I can speak Spanish to recognize when they are trying to rip me off. 

The bus ride itself was mostly passed in a sleepy stupor as Liz and I dozed for most of the 5 hours. We periodically awoke, took in the beautiful sight of the surrounding greenery, then fell back asleep. Once in Quito, the capital of Ecuador and a bustling metropolis, we decided to give the public transportation a try. Since using the Trolle (a bus with its own lane) costs only 25 cents, while a taxi would have been 10 dollars or up, it was a fairly easy decision. The bus itself was in great condition and getting to the part of town we needed to be in proved to be quick and painless. From the terminal we walked to our hostal, stopping along the way for lunch. 

After checking in to the hostal, we had decided we wanted to venture to a museum about 10 blocks away. However, after about 2 blocks, we were met with a huge and heavy downpour. We ducked into a café to try and dry off and wait out the rain. Well, we waited, and waited, and the rain did not stop. So instead of trying to slog it down to the museum, we simply returned to the hostal to change into dry clothes and get warm. Since the heavy downpour did not abate all afternoon, and we did not have any more clothes to spare, we stayed at the hostal to watch some movies and stay warm in bed. We only got out at one point to make dinner, but then quickly retreated back to the warmth of the blankets. While we didn’t get to see too much of Quito, we did catch up on some movies. We only hoped that the next day would see a stop to the rain and allow us to venture out a bit easier.
