Today was another early riser, although slightly later than yesterday. I got to wake up at 5am instead of 430am (its a small victory okay). I returned to the same village with the same teacher. We rode in the same cab, although today there were 4 of us in the truck space, it was extremely cramped, I couldn't even move. I'm just glad that we were the first ones to get out of the car. Also, I figured out the make of the car, its a Toyota Corolla extended hatchbak. They're extremely common here. The reason I checked is because our driver was adjusting one of his rims before we left, with a sledge hammer. Exactly. 

Today I spent most of the day teaching the children how to use the eToys activity. The teacher was extremely into the idea of having the kids learn more about the activities while I was there, especially concept maps. For the first half of the day, I taught them how to use the eToys activity to create books. This is a great way for them to combine pictures, text, and sounds. After recess, I taught them how to make concept maps (word bubbles with arrows). This they were able to understand quite easily and by the end of the class were helping each other make more complicated things. It is quite interesting to see how certain kids grasp the concepts faster than others. It's also really exciting to see them help each other and learn together. 

We were once again served breakfast and lunch. Breakfast consisted of a herb tea that is supposed to help with digestion (I don't know if that was a bad sign) and some herb-fried french fries, with a fried egg. It was extremely delicious. We had essentially the same french fries for lunch, but with rice, and also a herb soup with cheese. Also delicious. After lunch, class was ended and we trotted back the 30 mins to the bus stop. Luckily the bus wasn't as crowded today and I was able to sit in a seat, whereupon I took a nice little nap. 

Upon arriving back into town, I went through the street vendors and picked up some tangelos and plantains for all of about .75$. I then trotted back to the hotel to shower off because I was so dusty and sweaty. I turned in my clothes to get washed (1.80 per kilogram) and set about working on things for the next day. Tomorrow I'll be going to a different village, Yupash, for a day of festivities.
