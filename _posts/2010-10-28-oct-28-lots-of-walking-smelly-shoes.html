Today I was woken up again at 530am the robber cleaners. I cleaned up, took some photos of the sunrise, and was ready to go when school started.

<em>Sunrise</em></p>
I anticipated that we would only have battery sufficient for about 2.5 hours at most, so I told the teacher I planned on leaving around recess. She agreed, mostly because walking to Cochabamba, where I could hopefully find a car would probably take about 2.5 hours. For the morning session, I did a review with the kids and then was able to cover some new topics. I felt that I had to rush, but didn’t have a choice. I think the kids got quite a bit out of the workshops and only wish they had electricity so that they could explore their laptops further.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Upacoto by Jpatzer, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5125989066/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1243/5125989066_2294812c84_z.jpg" alt="Upacoto" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>The class of Upacoto</em></p>
When recess showed up, I suited up – big backpack on back, small backpack on front, and now walking stick in hand – and was off. I was accompanied by three of the older students who were to serve as my guides. Since they were about half my size, I felt like Gandalf and they were the hobbits. I didn’t try to convey this, it would not have translated well I think. They walked with me for a little over an hour to the top of the ridge, where they pointed out how to get down to the town. As a parting gesture the oldest one asked to be paid. I laughed and told them that they could have candy but that I would not give them money. After this, it was mostly downhill (which starts to hurt one’s feet after a while) until the town. I got to town at about 1245, but unfortunately there was no car. Soooo, I kept walking down the slope to get to Pariacoto. After about an hour or so, a car happened to come by. Luckily, it was filled with teachers who knew me, and I was able to pile into the trunk area. After about 15 minutes (which would have been probably another 1.5hour walk) we were in Pariacoto. I am lucky a car came by, not because I was tired, but because my feet were starting to hurt. After walking downhill for so long, they felt completely pounded. I think I might have lost about an inch in height during the day, not a good thing for me!

I got lunch with the teachers and then we waited for another couple of hours for the bus. Eventually the bus showed up, we fought for seats (Peruvian buses are not for the faint of heart, or poor old ladies), and by 5pm were on our way back to Huaraz. We got back to Huaraz around 830pm and I made my way to the hotel. At the hotel, they told me they were full, and to come back the next day. The owner has another hotel that he recommended going to, but since Hope and Josh had already been there and described how much is SUCKED, I decided to go to our back-up hotel, the hotel Las Vegas (reminds me of Raúl, a friend in LV doing TFA). While the hotel Las Vegas has much faster internet, it is also close to the market which makes it a bit louder. However, this didn’t bug me much in comparison to my shoe smell. Imagine shoes that are dusty and sweaty and don’t get changed for weeks, do you feel your nose wrinkling? Well, my did when I took them off my feet, so I got some incense to burn to combat the smell. It worked surprising well and I’ll make sure to get some talc powder for my shoes to help combat the smell further.

The funny thing about being away from the internet for a few days, is when you get it back, you’re like an addict. You stay glued to it for hours, doing nothing but getting plugged back in. Well, I was up late on the intertubes and fell asleep disappointed I did not have more energy to keep going. Overall, a long, very trying week, but satisfying. Everything one could hope for from such an adventure.
