Today was an early riser for us. We were up at 640ish to get ready for our big training day at the ministry, I even shaved. We got ready and hopped in a cab to make our way to the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library). We were able to experience the Lima morning traffic rush, which wasn't that bad actually. Upon arriving at the Ministry, we promptly went to the front of the line to ask for "Carlos", our babysitter for the day. Those in the line promptly gave us death stares and cursed us under their breath for not standing in line. Although their victory was soon had as we were told Carlos wasn't there, so we'd have to wait (smiles from the line). So we waited for Carlos to show up, which he did, then we got to really cut the line, HA! Carlos is a nice, opera loving (and blogging) gentleman, that was the only person to speak with us in English the entire day. He showed us in, bought us coffee, and did a quick introduction. Here began the interesting part...

We were introduced to Marie Antoinette, who of course only speaks rapid spanish in a vocabulary I've yet to even think of mastering, and Carlos asks us to all introduce ourselves, talk about our school, where were from, what we studied, and WHY WE WANTED TO DO THIS PROGRAM. Of course, IN SPANISH, for the benefit of Marie. Hope went first, sounded great with her spanish, and wowed them. Next I was to speak. I bumbled through a explanation, with Marie finishing and correcting words. Then, because Carlos had to step out of the room for a phone call, he returns, and asks us to repeat. So I stumble around like a 1st grader, againnnn, Marie corrects almost everything, againnnn, and Carlos nods and smiles at my imbecile attempt to sound knowledgeable about myself. Josh follows behind and does pretty good, although still incurs the correcting wrath of Marie!

For the rest of the day, we spend time learning how to motivate the teachers to use laptops. Negotiate with them! Apparently the kids learn great on them and master the technology quickly, but the teachers are difficult to convince. We were taught how to repair the software of the laptop, the most issues simply require flashing the laptop. We had a spectacularly large lunch of chicken and french fries, with an Inca Kola (bubble gum soda) to wash it down. I promise myself at Lunch to go for a run later. Once we finished we returned back to the hostel, to make bus reservations for our trip to Huaraz (on Thursday morning) and try to find a place to stay (almost got that). Then I went for my run, and felt like I wanted to toss my cookies the whole time. Afterwards, we got some food, I didn't puke, of the Chifa (chinese) variety that tasted just like Panda Express. After my chinese experiences in San Francisco, I probably won't go back :P

Esta todo para ahora, Buenas Noches!
