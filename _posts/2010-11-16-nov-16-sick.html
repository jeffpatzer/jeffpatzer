Today was no good. When my alarm went off at 6am and I felt terrible. I had a bad throat ache and a head ache, plus I felt fatigued. Rather than venture out into the rain that was coming down, I decided to call it a sick day. I spent the day alternating between naps and watching Survivor Man. However, the day wasn't a completely wash, I did get laundry done! I was down to the last pair of boxers.
