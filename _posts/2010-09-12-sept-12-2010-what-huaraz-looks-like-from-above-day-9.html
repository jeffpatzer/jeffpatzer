Today was an early wake up call. Hosh headed off to the bus around 730am for their two weeks in the village. I switched rooms to a single one from the triple that we were sharing. I unpacked things a bit and organized them since I'm going to be in this room for about a month. I even got a desk! Thank goodness, because my back was starting to hurt from having to work on the bed so much. I tried out the cheese this morning, the closest thing in taste and texture that I can relate it to is mozzarella, although the flavor is a bit different.  

After I was finished organizing, I grabbed my pack and headed off to check out a lookout over the city. It was probably about a 4-5 mile round trip walk (I'm guessing). The road takes a winding path up into the hills above the city. Eventually you arrive at a turnout for cars, that allows one to take in the whole valley of Huaraz at once. It really is quite impressive when viewed up on the hill. While the city is a decent size, you can also see that it isn't that big. It's definitely walkable, which makes it convenient to live in (don't have to take a taxi). Although I could have turned around at this point, I continued up the hill until I reached the end of the road. What I found there was extremely surprising, it was a private suburb. The suburb looked like it could have been found in military housing (a new one) development. The houses were new, the streets clean, and of course, the gate was guarded by two armed guards. We chatted for about 10 minutes and then I began to make my way back to town. 

Once back in town, I was starving. I tried to go to a trekking/pizza pub to check the place out and to get some pizza. Unfortunately their kitchen was closed and since I didn't want to book a tour, I left in search of something else. I decided to return to the restaurant where I had gotten a 5 sole (1.80$) lunch a couple days before. I had made the right decision. The dish I got was a fajita-like dish with french fries (they are literally in everything), and it was so delicious. I think those guys will be seeing a lot of me over the next few weeks. I mean, I can't even cook food for myself that cheap, they also give you a soup and this apple juice that is very tasty. 

After lunch I headed back to the hotel to work on some various things and relax after my long walk. I didn't do much the rest of the night beyond getting ready for tomorrow. It was nice to just relax :)
