Today I was up again at 6am on my bed of sheep skins. Packed up my things and got ready for the school day. Once again, there was miscommunication and I was served two breakfasts. This might not sound like an issue, but you can only eat so much soup, rice, and potatoes before saying enough is enough. Either way, we got on with the kids and started the day without a hiccup. The older kids were to copy down a description from the board into their laptops. This was while the younger ones drew in their notebooks. Essentially, because there are four grades in the class, you have to set the kids to tasks to keep them occupied. This occupied most of the school day with the more keen younger kids joining in with the laptops. 
Since school only lasts until one, time tends to go by quickly in the class. I used today to also show the teacher a few things with the laptops. This is such that she will be able to better use them in the future. However, and I’ve mentioned this before, the method in which the laptops get used is very closely linked to the ability and aptitude of the teacher. In this case, the teacher did not know how to really use the laptop, and such the activities that she was assigning were not really appropriately designed for the kids. It is difficult for me to protest because I do not wish to injure the pride of the teacher and also I am not there long enough to outlast the teacher’s “assignments”. Either way, the kids often do not know how to fully use the activities assigned, so I use the opportunity to expand their knowledge. I guess you could call this the compromise that I forge with the teacher (unbeknownist to them). 
After school, since this is election weekend, the teacher and myself walked the 25 minutes to the town of Pira to meet the other teachers and watch the election rally. In Peru, it’s common to have upwards of 10 candidates, so of course at the rally there were a couple bands. Of course, this means they play at the same time, so what was at one point indistinguishable music becomes a pure ruckus. Somehow the people can dance to it with intersperses of “Si Se Puede” or “Yes we can”. After an hour or so in Pira, we clambered into the Cambio (van) for the 1.5 hour ride back to Huaraz. I was in the back with little airflow, so it was hot and sweaty. However, this was not an issue, because I hadn’t showered for about 5 days, so it didn’t really make a difference. 
Once back in Huaraz, I accompanied the teachers to their candidate rally. We were able to wrangle some free beer and chicken, which was cool. It doesn’t seem to matter what country you are in, but free food draws the crowd. After this I walked back to my hotel and met up with Hosh. I took a shower (the first in five days) and we went for a Indian/Mexican dinner served by a guy from northern Great Britain. He was an absolute character. Talked about his experiences with trying to do business with the locals and their inabilities to follow through. He was a bit frustrated, but full of good info. I’ll probably probe him for more info, as well as buy some of his sauces for the rice and potatoes that I will likely be eating. 
After a long dinner of meat and vegetables (things not found in the Peruvian diet) Hosh and I watched Toy Story 3 while surfing the internet (the drug not available during the week). On a side note, most Peruvians ask me if people in the US are vegetarians, I tell them no but that we eat more vegetables with our meals. I tell them we eat meat and other things as well. They find this odd and seem to think I am crazy. Either way, they think I’m weird because I don’t eat Guinea Pig on a regular basis, but that it is a pet. It’s hard to explain the differences in culture sometimes. Back to the story, we relaxed and finished up the movie and called it a night. We have a few days of relaxing ahead of us that we are all looking forward to. We plan on visiting some thermal baths during the weekend.
