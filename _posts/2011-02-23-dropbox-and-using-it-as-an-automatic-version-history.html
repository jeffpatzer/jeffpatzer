First off, sorry for the lack of posts. I plan on trying to get back into a more regular flow. It has been difficult because I've been searching for a job (more info on that in later posts) and focusing on doing CODING PROBLEMS.  Anyways, I first off apologize for the lack of posts and hope to make it up with something useful here.

While many people use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, there are still a lot who don't, and sadly, a lot of people who don't realize how useful it can be. I should explain that Dropbox is a free online storage company that allows you to have a built-in folder to your computer that automatically syncs to the cloud and any other computer you have Dropbox installed on (literally drag-n-drop functionality). My main reason for this post is to describe the version history feature that can be an <strong>absolute life saver</strong>. 

Version history, in its most simplest terms, is a way to keep track of something as you change it. So say you have a word document, everytime you save it, you overwrite the previous state, but with a version history, you will actually be saving a new state. What do this really mean? Let's say you mess something up, or just want to go back to a prior version of a document, getting there could be a real pain (how many times can I press undo...). However, this is where Dropbox steps in. 

By having a document saved in your Dropbox folder, every time you save it, it actually gets reuploaded as a new version. Translation - AUTOMATIC File BACKUP. That is an amazing feature. Lets break that down into sections. 

AUTOMATIC - You don't have to think about it. This is a great thing. 

BACKUP - You have a copy forever accessible on the Dropbox website. This is a amazing thing. (Ever have a hard drive die? Life saver!)

So now instead of manually saving a file as File1 or File2 to determine versions, simply save it and you'll have a dated history snapshot of the file. And that my friends is amazing. 

If Dropbox sounds like something you'd like to use, simply click this link - <a href="http://db.tt/NvekR2h">http://db.tt/NvekR2h</a> - and sign-up. You'll help me out by giving me a bit more space (everytime you refer someone, you get more space) and you'll help yourself by not losing files anymore.
