Recently I had to figure out a solution to deal with groceries. I have a few roommates and coordinating the grocery shopping can get a little hectic. Making sure two people don't buy the same things or that nobody gets things, can be a big problem! Trust me, hungry people are not happy people :)

So, after hearing the "we SHOULD figure out a better way to do things," I mentioned that we could probably find an application that would allow us to use our phones to solve our grocery woes. I searched around a bit and found a great post on life hacker (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5479742/ziplist-is-an-impressive-grocery-list-tool-with-coordinated-shopping-anywhere-access">view post</a>) about an application called ZipList. Luckily Ziplist proved to be the perfect solution.

Ziplist allows us to use our smartphones (Android and iPhone) to keep a common grocery list synced among four people. In addition, its got a recipe feature that allows you to add a recipe to your account and then automatically import those ingredients into the grocery list. They have another feature that is pretty cool, although not too well implemented yet, that allows you to add the stores that you normally visit and organize the store aisles. What this means is you can have your list automatically lay itself out according to aisle to streamline what you pickup and where. The only problem is you have to do the layout by hand the first time, which is somewhat of a pain.

Ziplist has a website and apps for Android and iPhone which makes it a near-perfect fit for grocery shopping.
