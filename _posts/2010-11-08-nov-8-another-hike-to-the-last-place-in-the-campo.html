Today, although I did not have to be up early, I was awake by 6am due to some blaring music coming from another room. I roused myself and began packing. The teacher came to the hotel around 9am so that we could head to the bus. We made a few errand stops on the way, and were at the bus stop by 930am. The bus was due to leave at 10am, it was out of the gate early at 1030am. What amazed me most about this is not that the bus was late, but that I have become accustomed to it. It doesn’t really faze me anymore. However, this might be due to the knowledge that whether or not the bus leaves on time, I still have to sit on it for about 3 hours (or more). What’s the rush? Wait here, wait there.

For Monday and Tuesday I would be working at a town called Coltus. On the map given to me by the specialist, this was the one furthest away. While the bus ride wasn’t the longest, that was the one to Pampas Grande (6 hours), our 3 hour bus ride was not short by any means. When we arrived at the point we needed to disembark, we still had another 2 hours of walking ahead of us. Our trek took us up the mountain side (35 mins to about 4300meters), across the plains along the top of the hills (90 mins), and back down the other side (45 mins to about 3800meters). Luckily it was quite a nice day, and although brisk, the walk itself was not too difficult. Time passed somewhat quickly as I talked to the teacher about his previous job as a Guide in the area. Out of curiosity, I asked which tourists were the worst, without hesitation he replied Israelis. That was the same thing the mountain bike guide said. A pattern perhaps?

During our descent to the village, it’s really only a gather of mud houses, I noticed one important thing: no power lines. The first thought that went through my head was, again? However, when I asked the teacher about the power situation, he informed me that they had a solar system. Awesome! I asked how he got it, thinking that maybe the government had gotten their job right. He replied that some random group of 3 volunteers from the University of Michigan showed up about 7 months prior to deliver a system. They came on their own and the government had, and still does not have, any knowledge that they were coming. Random huh? Well luckily, that means we can charge laptops. I asked what the teacher did before this and he told me that he would carry about half the batteries, but only half, because they were heavy. This meant the laptops could only be used for at most one day, now they can be used every day. Props to the people of Michigan, well done guys!

After we rested a bit and had a snack, it was beginning to get dark. This was also accompanied by the loss of all warmth as it became very cold, due to the altitude is my guess. This did not deter the villagers, since apparently, they gather to watch movies most nights in the school. One of the parents has a generator with which to power the TV and DVD player. We ended up watching “Clash of the Titans,” which in my opinion is a weird situation. Here I am, in rural Peru, with people who have probably never heard of Greece, watching a Greek myth. I think the story was somewhat lost on them. Either way, the original version is definitely better than the new one that came out recently, so if you’re going to watch Perseus kill Medusa, watch the original. After the movie I set up my bed of sheep skins on the floor of one of the school rooms, crawled into my sleeping bag and passed out. While this may sound somewhat dirty, and it is, it is also super warm, so I cannot complain.
