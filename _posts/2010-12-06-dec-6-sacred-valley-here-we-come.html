Today Liz felt a bit better and as a result, we were able to make our way into the Sacred Valley. We were in a Colectivo around 10am and off for the 1 hour ride into the Sacred Valley. Since Liz had spent the previous day in bed, we had to skip the town of Pisaq and go straight to Ollantaytambo. The Sacred Valley, lying north of Cusco, is dotted with small towns which are usually accompanied with close-by ruins. Ollantaytambo is the last town in the Sacred Valley before one has to board a train to Machu Picchu.

Liz and I arrived in Ollantaytambo a little after lunch. After finding a hostal, we went in search of food. When we had finished eating our meal, we decided to visit the close-by ruins. Now, when I say close-by, I really mean close-by. The town sits in a small valley and is guarded over by a massive set of ruins that starts at the edge of town and stretches up the hillside. Starting at the bottom of the hill one climbs up the terraces until you reach the top. You are treated to a series of old houses and other structures along the way. Overall, although a small set of ruins, it is quite impressive. After the ruins, Liz and I spent the rest of the day watching some shows and reading our books. Since I did not have internet I could not waste my time on that endeavor (sadly).
