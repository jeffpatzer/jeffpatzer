Saturday and Sunday have flown by as Hosh and myself have tried to catch up on paper work and reports. We spent the majority of each day in cafes working and enjoying the fruits of the internet. We made sure to eat lots of non-peruvian food in anticipation for what will be coming this week. We had Thai food last night that was quite enjoyable, two american breakfasts, and pizza tonight. We feel we are ready to face the potatoes, rice, fried egg food for the next week. Luckily we will both only be working from Monday - Thursday, returning to Huaraz on Thursday. Also, Josh and Hope will be much closer to Huaraz, meaning they won't be spending the entirety of two weeks out in the village. 

Yesterday it also started raining, so today we made a point to go and buy rubber boots. This is in anticipation for the dust that will turn to mud when it really starts raining out in the villages!

I'll be offline again starting tomorrow until Thursday afternoon. I'll make sure to take lots of notes about all the interesting things that I'll be doing!
