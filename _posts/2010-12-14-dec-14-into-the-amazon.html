<em>Down the rabbit hole</em></p>
Liz and I were up early in the morning such that we could catch an early morning bus to Tena. We were on the bus and out the terminal by 7am. The bus ride itself was mostly uneventful, but the scenery was once again beautiful. As we slowly descended into the Jungle, or the Oriente or Selva as the Ecuadorians call it, the surrounding green became even more permeating. Just to give perspective, about half of the country is Amazon rainforest, but most of the forest is inaccessible. There are still undiscovered tribes that live in the deeper parts of the forest. And in case you are wondering, they don’t want to be discovered, because they kill anyone that stumbles upon them. If you would like more information, I highly watching Survivor Man’s episode on the Amazon rainforest (he goes to Ecuador for it) and almost gets eaten by a Jaguar.

A little before lunchtime we pulled into Tena where we were greeted with a blast of humidity. I immediately began to sweat and within about 5 minutes my shirt was soaked. It did not help that I had to carry my backpack to the hostel, about 1km away. I should elaborate on the reason we chose to come to Tena. It is renowned for world class rafting. It is surrounded by a smattering of rivers of varying difficulty which allow any adventurer the level of difficulty they desire. After getting a place to stay, a place called “A Welcome Break”, which was quite clean and very cheap, we meandered around the town. The town itself is quite small and can be walked very fast, which made the overall meandering quite short.

We did however investigate rafting companies and jungle tours. We arranged a rafting tour with a company called <a href="http://www.riverpeoplerafting.com/">River People</a>. They were not the cheapest, but they were the most talked about. In addition, when choosing to do something like rafting, I am not against paying a bit more to ensure my safety. For instance, our hostal was offering rafting trips for about 25$ less, but his raft looked like something I would buy at Walmart. We booked a Class IV river called the Jondachi-Hollin (pronounced Hondachi-Hoyin).

After booking the rafting, we scoured the town (all few blocks) for a good deal on jungle tours. Unfortunately, to get the full force of the Amazon, one has to venture about 8 hours by bus to a place called Limoncocha. Since Liz and I did not have sufficient time for that, we opted for a one-day tour that would introduce us to the plants and basics of the jungle. (I’ll put in a quick review on the tour in the Dec 16 post).

When we had finished arranging everything, we decided that we needed to go for a swim in the river that ran through town, but wanted to see the zoo first. According to the guide book, there was supposed to be an animal sanctuary in the middle of the river. However, we could not find the bridge that was supposed to be link the island to the bank of the river. Since the water was only about 50ft across and about knee-deep, we simply waded across to the island. Once we scrambled up the banks, we were greeted by a very weird sight. Instead of there being an animal sanctuary, it was only a small smattering of animals walking around freely, with some in cages. We were quite confounded, since it was supposed to be a very well-established mini-zoo. Rather there were monkeys swinging through the trees, a ant-eater like animal walking around, and a few other animals in cages.

The most interesting animal though was a monkey, called Daniel, in a cage. When you got close, he would reach out his tail and his hand through the bars to touch you. His tail was extremely strong and could curl forcibly around your finger. It turns out that Daniel had gotten too aggressive and had to be put in the cage to protect people and the other animals. After walking around the small island, and seeing that most things were overgrown and unkempt, we were very confused as to why the guide book had talked about the place with such gusto. We found out from some other people at the hostal that there had been a flood in April of that year which had essentially wiped out most of the animals. The remaining ones were simply the survivors. This also explained the lack of a bridge, because that had been washed away.

After our "animal safari", Liz and I walked to the swimming part of the river and spent a good amount of time cooling off. The cool water was a welcome respite after all the humidity. When we thought we were sufficiently cool, we returned to the hostal, changed into dry clothes, and went out to find dinner. As for dinner we decided to make food, if only so that we could eat vegetables. Despite the street meat (my term for the vendors) being delicious, they don’t serve vegetables. So while it would be cheaper to eat out, we opted to cook so that we could eat some veggies. After dinner we chatted with some of the other people at the hostal and called in an early night in anticipation of rafting the next day.
