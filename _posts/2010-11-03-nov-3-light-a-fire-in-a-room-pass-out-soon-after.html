Today I woke up feeling amazing, in comparison to yesterday. The 630am walk to school felt like a skip in the park. Well kind of, it was still 45 minutes up a 5-30% grade (it fluctuates, for pity assume it’s always higher :P ). The day flew by in a relatively quick blur. We worked on a variety of different activities and before I knew it we were on our way back to town. Nothing out of the ordinary occurred, except that the teacher’s propane tank ran out of gas. What this meant is two things, one of the student’s mothers made us lunch and I got to carry down an empty gas tank back to town. While they aren’t too heavy, 45 minutes of a metal tank bouncing on my shoulders is not the most enjoyable experience. But, did I complain? No, I took it like a champ, telling every Peruvian I asked that it was light and easy to carry. This of course impresses them and will lead to legendary stories about my strength.

Once back in town I helped the teacher along with a friend of hers, move into a different room. This was a somewhat uneventful process, until she decided to light a fire to burn some old papers and pieces of plastic, in the room. While I love a good fire, it tends to be better to do this outdoors, in a fire pit, rather than on the concrete floor in a confined space where your only hope of not passing out is to crouch down. Add in a bit of burning plastic, and why you’ve got a room full of smoke and carcinogens. Needless to say, if I knew her better I would have some choice words to throw in her direction for this brilliant decision. However, being the gentleman I am, I settle for the witty sarcasm of “She’s trying to kill us!”, while it doesn’t have the same ring as “What the f&amp;*k are you doing?!”, I think I got my point across. After this, we had some dinner and I returned to my room to go to sleep, somewhat more lightheaded than before the fire.
