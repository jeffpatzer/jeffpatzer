As of now there is less than 24 hours until I am on a plane on my way to Peru. If you are wondering, am I excited?, duh! Anyways this post won't be long just giving a quick <strong>run-down of  my setup</strong> and the things that I am taking.

When considering that I am going to be gone for about four months, I had to really consider the best way to keep things light. I decided that I wanted to be able to carry everything with me at one time, so that moving around would be manageable. To this end I decided on the following set-up:
<ul>
	<li><strong>One large backpack - 70L Osprey Aether</strong>: This is the main bag that holds the majority of things like my clothes, sleeping bag, camping equipment, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>One small backpack - ~20L Camelback with 3L bladder</strong>: This will be an everyday backpack I can take with me when sightseeing or doing day trips.</li>
	<li><strong>One messenger bag - Performance bike messenger bag</strong>: This is my main bag for carrying things like my computers and camera.</li>
</ul>

The <strong>smartest thing that I did</strong> was to use lot of smaller bags and stuff sacks within the other bags. This helps to compartmentalize things and keep things organized. I've put all computer things in a bag, socks in a bag, camping and cook equipment in a bag. The idea is that I want to be able to get to things quickly and keep them from getting disorganized.

<strong>Snacks</strong>: Teddy Grahams, 2 packs wasabi mix from Berkeley Bowl (yum)

This is Sheba and Yoda (2 of Â 3 of my parent's dogs), it's purely for <strong>cuteness factor</strong>:
