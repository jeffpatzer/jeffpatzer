Today was a fairly standard day. The teacher did a lesson with the kids in the early part of the morning and handed over the class around 930am. We had enough time to build a game using Scratch. It took the majority of the day. After school ended around 1pm the teacher and I got lunch with one of the families. After lunch he held more class for a couple of the grades. He does this every day. Since he teaches a 22 kid, multi-grade class, he has parts of the class return after lunch to work with them more exclusively. The teacher was a great guy and his approach made a big difference with the students.

During this time, I spent it reading, walking around the area (it wasn’t that big), and waiting for it to get cold. Fortunately, it didn’t get as cold as the day before. After dinner we turned in early because I had to get up at 245am to leave and hike to the road where I could catch a car back to Huaraz the next morning.
