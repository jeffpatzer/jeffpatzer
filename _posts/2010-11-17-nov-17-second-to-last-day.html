  _aioseop_title: Second to last day of my OLPC Internship
  _aioseop_description: After almost 2.5 months, my time is coming to a close. I also
    learn more about what the interns over the summer accomplished.

Today was my second to last day of actual OLPC work in the field. I met the Specialist at 8am at his office. He hadn't been able to get a hold of the teacher to the school which I would be going, so he was going to take me. However, due to a meeting we did not leave until 9am. We got to the school around 930am. Luckily it was not much of a walk (surprising again) and I arrived for once not sweaty.

The school itself was quite small with only about 10 students. Another intern from over the summer had actually visited the school, but after investigating what he had taught, it turns out they did not really accomplish much beyond taking pictures and playing with the games. I dove right into Wikipedia and Escribir (writing activity) to practice copy and pasting text and photos. After this we created a Memorizar (Memory) game of spanish/english word translations. Based on the ability of the kids (more closely inability) to use the laptops, I have to seriously wonder what the interns over the summer were teaching the schools. Hope, Josh, and myself have heavily focused our efforts on making constructive workshops that explore the laptops educational facilities, not the games that come preloaded.

After the school day, we took the short Combi ride back to Huaraz and I grabbed lunch. Since it is my second to last day, I spent the afternoon packing. Hope, Josh, and myself will be heading to Trujillo tomorrow night for a few days of beach time!
