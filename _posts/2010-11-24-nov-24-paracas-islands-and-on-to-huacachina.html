**Pictures are to come, I haven't had enough time to go through them yet :)

Today we were all up early, around 620am, for our 730am departure. Our ride picked us up and drove us from Pisco to Paracas. The ride is quick and only takes about 15 minutes. We were driven to the 	wharf in Paracas, which is a nice, sleepy little town on the pacific. If one has the option of staying in Paracas, or staying in Pisco, stay in Paracas. Pisco is a sad, ghost of a town that is still deeply affected by the 2007 earthquake that struck and essentially leveled the town, and due to the construction a permanent haze of dust hangs over the place. Paracas on the other hand is a cheery place with an ocean front view and a variety of options for places to stay at. We made the mistake of staying in Pisco, partly because we arrived so late at night.

Once at the wharf, we got in line with all the other tourists to board one of the many boats that go to Ballestas Islands. After a few minutes we were shuttled onto one of the long, skinny boats and given seats in the very back row. Once on our way to the Islands, approximately a 30 minute boat ride, it became very apparent why sitting in the back is a bad idea. While the ride is not very bumpy, one gets sprayed periodically by a large splash of ocean water. This isn’t too bad, until you find it seeping down your seat and into your pants.

The islands themselves are dubbed the “Poor man’s Galapagos” and I would say that is a good description. While there are hundreds of thousands of birds, the actual variation of wildlife is quite limited. It is an interesting place, but I would never consider it a replacement for the fabled Galapagos. The whole tour lasts a little over two hours, which is plenty of time for the islands in my opinion. You can only take so many pictures of the same animals.

We were back in Pisco by lunchtime and grabbed lunch before embarking to Ica. We caught one of the myriad of buses that plies the Panamerican highway and one hour later were in Ica. Once in Ica, we caught a cab to Huacachina, which is a desert Oasis surrounding the little town of Ica. The town of Ica is unremarkable, except for the myriad of Pisco wineries that fill the area. Called the “Napa of Peru”, the wineries offer free tours with free tastings. After taking the quick cab ride to Huacachina and locating a place to stay, we signed up for a two winery and one chocolate factory tour to occupy our afternoon. Almost all the hotels and a myriad of private operators offer wine tours, so it is very easy and cheap to find one.

The first winery we visited, <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304040-d318929-Reviews-Bodegas_Vista_Alegre-Ica.html">Vista Alegre</a>, was a great place to learn about the making of Pisco. Pisco is a hard alcohol that is created from wine itself. It has a very light flavor and smells like a mix of rum and alcohol. Vista Alegre was an interesting in an educational sense, but the next place we visited was just plain fun. <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304040-d318927-Reviews-Bodega_El_Catador-Ica.html">El Catador</a>, the name of the second Pisco place, had a guide (if you can ask for Chemo, then joke with the ladies at the desk that he’s a bit overweight :P ) who was simply amazing. His grasp of English slang was the best I had seen, and he was able to crack jokes and explain the Pisco process in good detail. At the end he provided us with a serious tasting session that ended after about 8 shots. It felt more like a fraternity initiation rather than a tasting.  By the time we were ready to leave, we were stumbling to our cab, but absolutely satisfied. Hey, I mean we bought a couple of bottles. The chocolate factory turned out to be simply a chocolate store with some windows to peer in at the people making the chocolate. Since, Liz is a chocolate snob, and the place only had milk chocolate, we did not purchase anything. However, Hope and Josh bought about 8 pieces and ate them in about 2 minutes. I was both disgusted and impressed.

After the tour, we stopped by the grocery store on the way back to buy dinner. We opted for chicken in celebration of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday, and also because it looked delicious. We inhaled the chicken and soon after found that all we could do was watch a movie and drift off to sleep. It really is amazing how many things one can accomplish when they are not working.
