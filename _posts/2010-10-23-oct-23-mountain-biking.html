Josh and I were up early at 6am and out of the hotel around 650am for out 7am departure. Today we went mountain biking in the hills. It was amazingly fun. Josh did great, considering he had little mountain bike experience. I flew over my handlebars at one point, which was exciting. Our guide was great. The routes are essentially down through fields, roads, and walking paths. It was technical at places and easy at others. Josh and I both had a great time. We’ve made a deal with the tour company to make some promotional video and photos for them in exchange for future service. We’ll be shooting a mountain bike video next weekend with my Nikon D90. It was a very fun day, and despite both of our sun burns, our grins haven’t disappeared.

For those interested, in case you come across this blog during research, Josh and I went with Galaxia Expeditions. They were not the cheapest, but they had their act together the best. In the future, we will probably hire our guide directly. However, Galaxia Expeditions has a great setup, and while you will pay a bit more, they won't do you wrong.
