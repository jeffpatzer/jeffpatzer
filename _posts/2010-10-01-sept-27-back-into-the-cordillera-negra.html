Today was back to the field work. I was up at 445am for the 530 cambio ride into the Cordillera Negra. The cambio was absolutely packed with teachers, and they found my hiking backpack odd and heavy, but thought I was well prepared. I can settle for that! I was even able to crack a joke in Spanish. One of the older ladies was talking to me about my schedule and a guy in the back wanted to make sure that she talked to me about my schedule. Well since we had already finished this, she tried to tell him that, so I chimed in and said we had covered it. It made the whole group laugh. I was happy to have been able to do that :)

The cambio ride was about 1.5 hours with another 45 minutes of walking. I’m working in the village of Yurracancha, which has to be at 3300 meters at least. It’s not so warm, plus it doesn’t help that it is sprinkling off and on throughout the day. Overall the school day went by quickly, even though we only worked on one activity. The children reviewed a song in the morning and then had to type it into their laptops. While I can see the purpose in this, it took way too long and the kids had completely lost their focus after a while. I think we’ll be able to work on something a bit more engaging tomorrow (or at least I hope so). 

The teacher is a nice guy and so is the lady that lives right by the school. Most of the kids live pretty far away, so its really just the school and the couple houses. Fairly quiet in comparison to normal. Lunch consisted of potatoes/rice and some grain soup. Not too bad overall, minus the repetition. It really started to cool down in the afternoon and standing outside trying to listen to election banter (mostly to work on my ear), got quite difficult. It must have been in the high 30s. Dinner was another type of grain soup with some bread (another staple in just about everything they eat). This is mostly for my girlfriend Liz, but the people that live right next to the school have two cats, both less than a few weeks old. They are extremely small and adorable. One likes to meow all the time, it reminds me of Zach (her cat). I’ll be sleeping on the desks in the school house tonight. It’s definitely the biggest room I’ve ever had :)

No shower today. The toilet is a concrete hole :P
