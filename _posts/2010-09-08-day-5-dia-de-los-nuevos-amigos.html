For our last day in Lima, Hosh (Josh and Hope) and myself decided to venture back to Lima centro for a nice afternoon of exploring. We decided to try our luck with the bus system so that we could save some money (only 33 cents to ride) and also to experience how the locals travel. Needless to say the buses drive about as crazy as the taxi drivers, just with more mass. The other interesting part about their bus systems is street vendors can come on the bus to try and sell some snacks. 

Once we go to our destination, we found they were having a food festival. However, they were charging a ticket fee (which you had to stand in line for a long time) or of course you could scalp some tickets for a slightly greater fee. A Limeno (person from Lima) from Queens New York talked to us for a bit and tried to help us get tickets so that we didn’t get taken advantage of. He said that Hope’s Spanish (which is essentially fluent) wasn’t very good, which really pissed her off to Josh and mine amusement. However, once we learned that they were also charging for food inside, we abandoned this attempt. (First Friend of the Day)

After our failed attempt at the food festival, we started walking and ended up in a mall. It was fairly similar to malls in the states. We ate at the food court where Josh and I tried the local fast food chain Bembos. I got a hamburger with some sort of egg hash on it, the burger tasted more like sausage though. It wasn’t too bad, but I think I will try something else next time :-P. After our snack we made our way through Lima Centro, where we met another Limeno (Second Friend of the Day) who wanted to take us to his local bar. We were in the process of sharing a beer, when we were assaulted by an extremely drunk man. (Third Friend of the Day) He tried to sell us some things, we declined, so of course then he asked for a bit of beer. At this point, I would have told him to get lost, but our host gave him a bit, so the guy sat down and proceeded to talk with us (read, spit). He sat down between me and our Limeno friend, while Hosh were on the other side of the table. Let me say that this guy was extremely drunk and dirty, I was extremely uncomfortable! Hosh seemed to find my discomfort funny, needless to say I was not laughing. He continued to linger for too long of a time, talking to us about the random thoughts he has. Eventually we got the bar owner to get rid of the guy. We finished up our beers and began to say our goodbyes to our Limeno friend. At this point (and I feared this might happen), he mentions he has three kids, only works a couple of days, etc, and wonders if we could give him some money to buy them dinner. We offer to buy them some food, but of course that won’t do. So we give him nothing and say goodbye. 

At this point we begin to make our way towards Parque de la Reserva (park) to see a light show. We met up with a couple friends of Hope’s (Fourth and Fifth friends of the Day), both doing Fulbright scholarships in Peru. We got a quick bite to eat, I had a nice pie and a hot chocolate, then we returned to the park and watched the light show. It was quite impressive (see the attached videos). Afterwards, we said goodbyes and got on a small bus back to our Hostel. Let me say that there are a couple types of buses in Lima, and Peru in general, those that are public and those that are private ones. The private ones, combis, are like big vans. They speed from corner to corner, with a guy hanging out of the door yelling sing-song the destination. They push you into the van and speed along. Our door dude (for lack of a better term), knew people along the way. He jumped out and grabbed a friend’s cigarette, puffed it and got back in, Josh and I were floored. We made it back to our Hostel in one piece with a few good stories from our day. We packed up our things to prepare our things for the trip to Huaraz the next morning. What a day of new friends!
