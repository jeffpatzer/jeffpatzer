I apologize for a lack of updates. I arrived back in LA around 930 and was back in San Diego with my family for the past few days. I will be releasing my official review of my time in peru and the OLPC program there over the course of the next week. It will be a series with a piece releasing every day. Make sure to come back tomorrow (6am if you're chipper) to start reading it. 

Happy New Year everyone :)
