    amount of food from their parents. The government provides bread and milk for
    their school snack.

The kids in the schools do not eat very much food. This is not to say that they are not hungry, merely that they do not have a large amount of food to eat. The school day itself is limited by this fact. School typically lasts from 8am to 1pm. Sometimes kids will return in the afternoon for a couple hours, but this is dependent on the teacher, school, and geography (whether or not travel is easy enough to return). The kids will have a small breakfast at home that at most consists of a few potatoes and some Arina (what to me seems like the liquid part of oatmeal). They then arrive at school and will get a small snack at lunchtime. This will consist of government provided bread known as papapan (father bread) and some fortified white liquid drink prepared by one of the mothers of the students (the powder to make the liquid is also provided by the government). They call this liquid leche or milk, however it taste more like liquid dough. While neither of these things is a tasty endeavor, the kids inhale all of it quickly because they are starving. Both of these items are provided by the government, because if the kids did not have this snack, they would not eat anything until dinner time. <object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QhMFNQhVUhA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QhMFNQhVUhA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>
