On Oct 2 we went to the Hot Spring baths by the town of Marcara and tried to hike to a lake above them. According to my guide book, this should only have taken about 1.5 hours. However, at the 1.5hr mark we were (according to the locals who laughed when we told them where we going) still 3 hours away. So we turned back, and since the "baths" were a putrid brown, we opted for cold drinks instead. After this we headed back to huaraz for a nice lunch. I found a place with the most authentic hamburgers to date. 

Sunday and Monday have been work and relax days. We spent both days in cafes (faster internet) doing reports and mentally preparing ourselves for the return to the cordillera negra. Oct 3 was election day and as a result most things were closed and people were filling the streets in support of their candidates. It was quite interesting. The weird thing is that its hard to distinguish between a happy and angry mob. We made sure to hide Hope to keep her safe (save the women I always say :)

Not much else to report beyond that. Tomorrow Hosh and me head back out into the Cordillera Negra for at least until Friday. This week we didn't have work monday due to disputed election results. Hosh will be at a fairly close school, while I will be traveling quite far. Hopefully I'll be able to make it back to Huaraz without too much difficulty. I'll have some walking ahead of me as well, at least an hour between places :P
