Today I was up at 5am, although I was awake long before this due to the dog barking. I used the “water spigot” to wash off my face. I then gathered my things to wait for the 6am bus to the next town, Llanca. Upon arriving at Llanca, one of the teachers was awake and waiting for me. We chatted for a bit until one of the students showed up to take me to his house for breakfast. Breakfast consisted of French fries, bread, and a fried egg, plus some NesCafe coffee (with lots of sugar, which is how they drink their coffee).  I ate alone with the kids staring at me. 

I must interrupt my traditional story to describe some observations that I have made regarding the local culture. Most often I am asked similar questions by the locals. These include where I’m from, why I’m here, where I’m going, and since their elections are soon they are also curious about our system and how it works. They are also interested in the differences in prices between here and the USA. The thing they find the most interesting though has to be my ipod Touch. They don’t have ipod touches here, so it is a completely new piece of hardware. Additionally, I think I am one of the few white people for miles. I think the closest people are Hosh, who are in a different village. This makes me quite the oddity. Another thing is that Gringo is a non-offensive word. It is simply a term for white people. After living in California for such a while, this takes a bit getting used to. The last thing is that the majority of people cannot say my name. The sound is just difficult. So rather, I get called Joven (young guy) or Gringo (white guy). 

The teacher that I worked with today was a bit brusque. His method of keeping his class in-line was to yell at them. While this can be effective, it loses its bite after a while. Anyways, it became apparent that he didn’t know how to use the laptop very well. The way he tried to make use of it was not the most logical. Additionally, he didn’t know how to utilize back parts of the system. Nevertheless, we worked through things slowly, while he asked many questions. The kids were not quite interested because they were lacked discipline and I think, and this was probably a bigger part of it, any large amount of experience with the laptops. Once again, I was shown that the degree to which the kids learn is often tied to the teacher they have. 

I ate lunch with another family and was served a heaping pile of potatoes. I ate them all! After I returned from lunch, I worked on my laptop for a bit, until the professors finished their lunch. They then had a bunch of questions about all sorts of things. We spent the next few hours just working on the XO’s answering any questions and learning more about the activities. I think I really helped them in showing them what the system is capable of. This really helped to change the attitude of the teacher who wasn’t very familiar with the system. 

After this was time for dinner. Once again, I had potatoes, rice and a fried egg along with some sugar coffee. After dinner I went to the place where I would spend the night. I spent about an hour talking with the Señor and Señora about the laptops and lots of other things. The room I slept in was a step up in that it had a concrete floor and painted walls, plus a metal ceiling (no mud on my face while sleeping). I had to use the bathroom, and was shown to a shack with a hole; I decided to opt for the bushes for peeing again. 

Another interesting day, however, things were only to get better…
