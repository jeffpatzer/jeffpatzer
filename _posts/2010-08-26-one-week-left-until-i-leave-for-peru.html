Starting last fall, I attended an information session about One Laptop per Child and the internships they offer that span the globe. OLPC is the original creating of the netbook, dubbed the 100$ laptop by the media. Although the laptop does not cost this, rather around 190$, they did spark a revolution in cheap, mobile computing. They redesigned the laptop to work to teach children, to give them the tools to learn and make their situation better. As an EECS engineering student, this sounded like a great opportunity to spend time in another country doing some ecotourism. I applied as soon as the application was ready and was accepted soon after. Its now only a week away from my departure :)

My intern duties are described as "technical". This means that I will be traveling to different schools fixing laptops, setting laptops up, and aiding in the integration of the laptops with the everyday workings of the school. I will arrive in Lima and spend a week training. Then I will travel to the Ancash region with my two other fellow interns. We will be based in Huaraz and travel to different schools in the region. Most language spoken will be in Spanish :P
