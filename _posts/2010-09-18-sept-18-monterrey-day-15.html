Today I was able to sleep into 7am, but since my body clock was set so early, I couldn't get past that. The first thing I did was check the Cal-Nevada game (I had fallen asleep in the 3rd), and was saddened to see that Cal had been whooped. Sigh...

I ventured out to find breakfast, which consisted of bread and yogurt in the plaza de armas. This might sound nice, except for being bothered every 5 minutes by someone trying to sell you something. After breakfast, I went back to the hotel and packed my bag. I decided that I would venture down the road to Monterrey (15 minutes by Cambio). At Monterrey they have some baths (pools) fed by a springs. Instead, I choose to walk up into the hills directly behind the pools and spent about 1.5 hours exploring. Probably hiked up about 700 feet and then across the hill to a different one and back down. It was a nice little area with a small stream that runs through the area between the two hills (and feeds the pools). It's interesting because there is a concrete water aqueduct about 12inches wide and 15inches deep for delivering water from the beginning of the stream to different parts of the hill. This makes it possible for the people living in the hills to easily obtain water. 

After my hike I headed back to Huaraz, where I tried to visit the main museum. However, the lady that could sell me my ticket was on lunch, so the security guard said to come back in an hour. Really? I just headed back to my hotel to relax after my hike. After that I didn't do too much except work on various things and hang out. I'm storing up energy for my week ahead in the villages!
