Today I got up around 615, which is actually kind of late. I rolled off my desk bed (which I’ll be sleeping on tonight, although in a different school). I went about getting ready for the day as usual. I packed my bags up because I was going to have to leave after school to walk to the next school. 

During the school day we worked with Memorizar. This was a good and simple activity that allowed the kids to spend some time getting to know the laptops. For some reason, they are really uncomfortable with them. I’m not sure why, but it might be with how the teacher lets them use them. The kids probably need some open time to just play with and learn about the laptops. I’m wondering if the teacher was trying to hide things from me or not, I wasn’t sure. I got an interesting vibe that he might not let the kids use them that much, but I can’t really prove it. Anyways, the day went by and soon enough the kids had to leave. I was able to get a bunch of pictures that I hope came out alright. I also got a few videos. We ate lunch and I packed up the rest of my stuff and headed on out to the next school. 

The walk back to Pira, and the hope was from there to catch a combi, took about 1.25 hours. The entire walk was at a slight incline. Once I got to Pira, they were having a bit of an election celebration. This meant a lot of people were in the town square, which I skirted. Needless to say, I got a bunch of weird looks for my bags and didn’t stop to talk to anyone. Plus all the cars were there participating in the election stuff, so this meant I had to walk the extra 20-30 minutes to get to the school. 

Once I arrived at the school, and the small town (grouping of houses?), I searched out the person whose name I had been given. I found his house fairly fast, but then found out he wasn’t there. His wife was completely surprised by my presence. She had no idea who I was, why I was there, etc…So I explained my purpose, and she rallied to the cause, by helping me find the keys to the school (so I could sleep there). Then she went about finding some sheep skins (they look fresh!) and blankets for which I could use to make a bed on the desks. She set up dinner with one of the families and everything. This is pretty good considering I don’t think she really wanted to help. 

Other than that I set up my bed, ate some food, did some reading, and generally relaxed after my hike (walk). This however brings me to another point. The city of Huaraz is a mecca for trekking and other outdoor activities in the cordillera BLANCA, not the cordillera negra. Either way, when people ask me if I will be doing trekking, I generally respond with the fact that I’m walking to get to places, no more. Trekking will not be on my lists of things to do in my free time :)
