Today we rolled into Lima around 6am. Our bus stopped at their bus terminal, and we clambered off grabbing our stuff. Then the bus left, which we thought was odd. We were soon attacked by a mob of taxi drivers. We inquired about prices, and they quoted us a huge and large sum. We laughed at them, but then they informed us that we were in old lima, north of the city, rather than in the middle of the city, at the other bus terminal. This was a surprise, since no workers on the bus mentioned that there were two terminals. Anyways, instead we got a cheap ride to the "subway", which is really a dedicated bus lane that moves pretty quick. We were able to bus down to where our hostal is located, and then walked from the station to the hostal.

We ended up picking a hostal named HQ Villa, which was a great decision. This place is literally a villa with comfy couches and a great breakfast! Only about 7$ a day too, when sleeping in the dorms. We ate some breakfast and got ready for our day. I had been in contact with some local Lime√±os via a service (website) called CouchSurfers. We decided to meet up and soon enough we found ourselves in the back of their car getting a private tour of the city. We grabbed lunch at a arabic restaurant, which was a smart and tasty decision. After lunch, our guests took us back to their house where we chatted for a few hours. It was really interesting to see how more well-off Peruvians live, considering most of our time is spent with the other side of the social class. This is very different from the ways that they live, the fun they have, and their opinions that they have on their country.

We were eventually dropped off back near our hostal, where we met up with some friends to watch the world series. The two girls I speak of, were ones we met when we were first in Lima. They are both doing Fullbright scholarships/projects. It was great to catch up, eat a nice steak, and watch some baseball. We met at TGI Fridays, so it was a nice reminder of home. The workers at Fridays were decked out in some serious Halloween garb, which was cool to see. The bartender could do some pretty cool tricks too, which kept us entertained.

After dinner, we got some churros, which they fill with different fillings here. For instance, vanilla or manjar blanco. This makes them quite tasty and also super sweet. However, every once in a while won't hurt you. We got back to our Hostal around 10pm where we spent some time on the internet, and since our bus ride the night before had meant we hadn't slept that well, were in bed by 12pm. Overall, a long and enjoyable day. It was just the type of thing we need to give us a break from our normal routine.

I'd like to specially thank Ana and her friend Jesse for taking us around and showing us a great time. We are really thankful for all the time you spent with us!
