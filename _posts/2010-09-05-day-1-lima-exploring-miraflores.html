Wow, so first day in Lima. I spent most the day in Miraflores exploring the area. I woke up around 9am due to not having gone to sleep until around 2am. I slowly roused myself to shave, take a shower, and eat some complimentary breakfast rolls. At which point, I promptly packed my backpack with a guide book, a spanglish dictionary, some snacks, cameras and off I went (approximately 1030-11am). 

Left the Hostel and made my way down to the beach area. Really I was up on the cliffs overlooking the beach, but close enough. I walked along the cliff edge through a nice park, into another park called Lover's Park (see picture of massive statues making out) and on down into the trendy shopping center called Larco Mar. It's an awesome shopping mall built into the cliff side overlooking the ocean. There were a lot of people walking dogs and riding bikes along the cliff edge through the park. My favorite was the extremely decked out mountain bikers riding at about 5mph, I mean, what's the point if you aren't going fast and down a mountain? At this point I turned and walked up Larco Ave into the main Miraflores area. I found a supermarket to get some lunch, which consisted of about a liter of drinkable fruit yogurt (YUM) and a couple empenadas (meat filled pastry, again YUM). I ate and continued my way up into the downtown parks. 

At this point I decided to go and visit Huaca Pucllana, a massive mud brick pyramid in the middle of the city. Pretty interesting, there was a Peruvian hairless dog there. One of the ugliest creatures I've yet to see, but also interesting. His skin felt like oily cloth, very friendly too. On the tour I met a young Canadian lady (I really want to use the word chick, but I'm being PC, so YCL it is), who was also traveling alone for the day. We decided to pool our funds and take a taxi to a really nice museum. Spent a couple hours at the museum looking at old Peruvian artifacts, including the erotic room, and returned back to Miraflores to a sports bar to watch the Peru-Canada soccer game. Consequently this was also the best place to be to watch college football as well because it was packed with Americans. We ended up not watching most of the soccer game, but talking to a really helpful and friendly guy who gave us great tips on places to stay, where to go, and how to get there (Thanks!). So I watched some college football highlights (haha Ole Miss) and drank a Peruvian beer (YUM). After the game ended, Canada surrendered 0-2, uh I mean, lost, me and YCL walked to her tour bus where she left to take a night tour of downtown Lima. I noticed a large grouping of people across in the park and went to investigate. Consequently, it was a large group of strangers dancing, awesome! So I sat watching the people dance (you can too, see the video) and was talked to by two random guys for about an hour then a different guy after that. The second guy was super friendly, a network engineer for a phone company in Peru, and we went on getting some food and talking for another hour or so. I tried Inca Kola, Amos would love it because it tastes like Cotton Candy and bubble gum, don't think I'll get it again :/. After this, my brain having turned to mush from trying to not sound like a 1st grader speaking spanish all day, I returned to my hostel to promptly collapse. But not before writing this post for you all :)
