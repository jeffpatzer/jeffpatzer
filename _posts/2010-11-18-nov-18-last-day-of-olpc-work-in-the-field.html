Today was my last official day of field work for OLPC! While I still have a meeting on Monday to debrief with the ministry, the idea that I will not be traveling back out into the campo (country-side) and eating only rice and potatoes while not showering for long periods of time, does excite me.

As far as an experience today, it was a bit interesting. I was supposed to meet the teacher near the area where all the Combis leave from Huaraz to head in the direction I need to go, however the appointed time came and went and the teacher never showed up. Luckily I had run into the specialist on my walk over to the Combi area and had figured out the name of the bridge I was supposed to get off at. Armed with this knowledge, I jumped into the nearest combi and 15mins later found myself standing on the side of the road next to the Puente Mallaca. I trudged the 10mins up the hill and when I got to the school, the teacher did not mention a thing about us missing our rendezvous. I decided to also not bring it up.

The teacher wanted to spend a lot of the day doing Grabar, essentially taking pictures and videos, but I am personally not fond of this activity. It is something that does not provide any real educational benefit to the kids (we can argue about this if you want) beyond a cool factor. In fact, most of the activities in the Peruvian XO image are not very useful, simply games, and often times are full of bugs. For this reason I have developed, along with the help of <a href="http://hopeandjosh.com/">Hope and Josh</a>, a series of <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/olpc-workshops/">workshops</a> that I believe fully take advantage of the best activities of the laptop, but also optimize educational opportunity. For many schools using the laptops is synonymous with game time. While this is not all bad, the educational aspect is getting completely overlooked. Rather I spent the day creating a game in Scratch with the kids.

Our day was somewhat interrupted though. I got through about half of the game by recess. However, during recess the kids decided they wanted to antagonize a dog and have it chase them around. While of course they all ended up getting nipped, one girl decided that it hurt a lot. <em>Now, before I proceed any further, I do feel bad when people get hurt, especially children, BUT if you are antagonizing an animal and get hurt as a result I have very, very little pity for you. </em>Her bite was no worse than a scrape, but she decided that she needed to cry, and have her friends carry her because she could no longer walk, for about two hours. Needless to say, this essentially ruined most of the afternoon time that would have been used to teach. Rather I spent the time leaning against the wall wanting to yell at the kids for antagonizing and animal and then complaining that it reacted. What really pissed me off though, had to the teacher's reaction. Instead of isolating the girl, and taking the attention away from her, which was the only reason she kept crying, he allowed it to continue and sent some students to go and get the mother. Essentially this immobilized the whole day. Even if I was not there to teach, this would have wasted an entire half of a school day for the students. After this, my respect for the teacher was almost non-existent. <em>Before you call me insensitive, remember that these kids play around rusty broken nails, sharp pieces of wood, cook meals over fires at recess, and a myraid of other extremely dangerous things that never phase them, but one dog bite and she deteriorates. I don't think I'm insensitive, I think I'm realistic. If you'd like to argue this point with me, don't hesitate to comment at the bottom of the page. </em>

Other than this, it started to rain when we needed to leave. The combi ride back to town was uneventful and when I got into the hotel my first mission was to dry off. As for the plans for the next few days, Hope, Josh, and myself will be traveling to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trujillo,_Peru">Trujillo</a> for a few days of R&amp;R. We plan on visiting the beach first and foremost. After this we will head back to Lima for our meeting with the ministry. My girlfriend, Liz, will be flying down Monday night from San Francisco, and we will be spending the next few weeks (~4.5) traveling between Peru and Ecuador. Don't worry, I'll still be updating the blog! Just because my OLPC internship is over, doesn't mean the adventures will stop.

In the upcoming days I will have a post that will summarize my experience and provide an analysis of the OLPC program in Peru. Keep your eyes peeled, I plan on making it a good one :)
