Today was spent looking around at the sights, catching up on the internet, and testing tasty foods at the market. Liz had her first Papa Relleno and first Empenada. She loved both. The biggest sight we saw was the Casa de Moral. Not moral, like in how you conduct yourself, but moral like the really old tree in the middle of the courtyard. It was a very nice colonial house with a great rooftop view. It was really nice to take a relax day after the trek, and to also let my stomach return to normal. We had to catch an 11pm bus to Puno, so our night was unfortunately not spent out on the town :(
