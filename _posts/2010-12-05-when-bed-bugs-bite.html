Liz and I were on the bus from Puno to Cusco, when we began to develop a myriad of small red bumps. Well, my were small, Liz’s looked more like welts. As time wore on, they began to itch terribly. I mean, the type of itching that begins to control your every thought. You think about itching, you try to figure out ways to itch, you contemplate how to make the itching more efficient. By the end of the day, both Liz and I were completely consumed with the notion that every little red bump had to be scratched. However, the other thing that was bugging us (pardon the pun), was what had caused the red bumps. 

At first, we contemplated that perhaps we were allergic to something. However, knowing that we have no clothes or food allergies, we ruled that out. After looking over the bites again, we figured they might be some sort of mosquito bites. However, that didn’t fit because we had not come into contact with mosquitoes recently. The next thought that we discussed was bed bugs. The problem was that neither of us had any idea what bed bug bites should look like or the symptoms they should induce. To remedy this lack of knowledge we looked up what bed bug bites should look like, and sure enough, it was exactly what we had contracted. 

The last question Liz and I felt we needed to answer was, where did we get attacked by the bugs? After reading that the bites appear about 4-5 hours after being bitten, we assumed it was our hotel room in Puno. This really surprised us, because the place seemed quite nice. However, the timeline fit, so it must have been there. 

The problem with bed bug bites, is they itch like the devil, but there isn’t much you can do about them. You can put on soothing cream, but the only remedy it to wait them out. This can last a few days. In fact, as I write this, I still itch. Luckily, the bugs themselves do not carry diseases. Unluckily, they are extremely difficult to eradicate. They are microscopic, and as such, cannot be seen. To deal with this issue, one essentially has to steam their clothes and kill any potential bugs that still linger. If this does not solve the problem, then throwing out your clothes is the only next option. 

A valuable lesson has been learned though, hostel living is not also the healthiest or safest, but is an intricate part of the travel experience.
