Since my work week essentially started on Sunday, I will include that day in this post. Sunday was a nice relaxing day, I woke up, did some work, got a nice breakfast, and packed to get back on the 6 hour bus ride back to Pampas Grande. I was on the bus by 330pm, the bus left Huaraz around 4, and we got to Pampas Grande around 915. For about the first couple of hours I was seated next to an oversized (width-wise, then don’t come length-wise) Peruvian man. Now, this wouldn’t have been a problem except for the fact that it was hot with no windows open. However, it looked like he was as uncomfortable as I was, so I guess it was a wash. For sleeping quarters, the teacher and I slept on the bus since we were going to have to get up at 5am to make the trek down to the school. The bus was cold (the town is at 3600meters) and uncomfortable, I was actually glad to get up and start moving just to warm up. Also, I really mean trek because it was about 1000ft descending, with about 45lbs of crap on my back. Imagine a donkey trail with lots of rocks to slip on, with no light beyond the flash light on my head. 

By the time we got to school, my shirt was soaked and I was forced to change it out of necessity (I was getting cold). Also, since there aren’t showering facilities, I put on some deodorant and called it good. Plus, the kids all smell worse than me, so I don’t think they’ll mind. We had some breakfast and were working by 8am. I taught the kids a bunch of new things. The kids understood things quite quickly and were easy to teach. They were extremely quiet so sometimes coaxing answers from them was difficult, although by the end of the day it was getting easier. It also helped there were only three of them, only 4 total attend the school. We worked from 8-1, don’t worry the kids got a 30 min recess at 1030, and then got a 2 hour break for lunch.

The teacher and I ate at one of the students parent’s house (the usual set-up), BUT the food was different. Somehow, the mother included beans in the rice and potatoes, AND cut up the potatoes to be bite sized (rather than whole), HOWEVER the best part was it had some flavor. She used something and there was flavor, and it was MAGNIFICENT! There was also soup and corn. Not too shabby. 

After lunch the teacher and I spoke for a bit. He was mostly curious, just asking questions about things in the United States. However, he wouldn’t stop asking me about money I make, how much I’m being paid, what I’m paying for things, and so on and so forth. While this is normally uncomfortable, it’s definitely worse when you are trying to be discreet about your about the fact that your plane ticket costs probably as much as they make in a year. I actually saw a stat today that wowed me, the GDP in 2005 was 7$ a person in person. I’m sure its gone up a bit by now, but either way wow.

Around three we worked with the kids some more until 5. I was shown to a room at one of the parent’s houses, which actually isn’t too bad. Minus the fact that the bathroom is about 100 yards away and I have absolutely no idea where a spigot for water is. Meh, I’ll wash tomorrow, nobody here to smell me but myself (and after a while, you stop being able to do that, I’m not sure if that is good or bad).
