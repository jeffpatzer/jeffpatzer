Today was our last day as official OLPC interns. We were up early and out the door by 830am. We arrived at the ministry around 845am, got our badges (it only involved giving over our driver's licenses, pretty easy huh?), and were inside the compound within 10 minutes. We asked for our contact and were soon seated inside the same conference room in which we had been given our training.

We started off with the normal pleasantries and chit chat. We then launched into our prepared powerpointÂ presentation. We then spent the next 2.5 hours running through our experiences, a list of positives and negatives of the laptops, and finally recommendations to improve the overall program. Many of the negatives that we brought up were meant with excuses and explanations, or that they already knew they existed, either way by the end of the presentation they were not the most chipper. While we were tactful, we were also realistic. We told them the truth with the hope they would really want to change it. Either way, we got through the presentation and felt as if we had successfully communicated the challenges that face the ministry. We then went out to celebrate the end of our work with a hearty meal at a middle eastern restaurant. Hummus, yum!

After our return from lunch we had a discussion with our OLPC contact. We were able to recount our experience, again, and discuss the other aspects of the internship. It appears that OLPC is steering away from the on-the-ground type of internship and looking to implement more Graduate and PhD students who will perform observations and analysis. While this is a noble idea, it really doesn't help to train the teachers and aid the children. Rather it is more "solution-finding" than actually a solution, which is a real pity.

Tonight I will be picking up Liz from the airport, her flight arrives around midnight. I hope she will get through customs in under an hour. It will have been just about three months since we've seen each other, so it will be nice to be back together :)
