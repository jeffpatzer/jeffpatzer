Today, I got my first taste of south american land transport. Quite an experience, although not for the reasons you might think. We woke up early to take a taxi to the bus station. We got to the bus station around 9 (for our 930 departure), got our tickets and then went to wait at the departing terminal (I say this because the station was like a mini-airplane terminal). At which point the gate we were standing at was taken over by a TV commercial crew. Would this cause our gate to be moved? Of course, but not for another 20 minutes :/. Anyways, we got on the bus no problem and headed on our way (25 minutes late). 

We got second level seats in the front of the bus. This was great for two reasons: the view and its as far as possible from the terrible smelling bathroom. However, as we came to find out the bathroom smell would pale in comparison to the other passengers riding with us. We were traveling almost exclusively with a large group of Israelis. Now, don't misunderstand me, I am Jewish and harbor no ill feelings towards Jewish people, but these people were just plain rude! It was quite embarrassing. They had one person in their whole group that could speak English (for about 20 of them). The others consistently insisted (I use this term lightly because it was really more like yelling) that the stewardess (bus stewardess?) speak English too them. The poor stewardess. They were also quite pushy and disrespectful of others boundaries. The guy sleeping with me felt it was ok to just slouch over into my seat for a lot of the ride (see pic), until I started talking to him. Then we became more friendly and he knocked it off. He was traveling with a couple friends around south america for about 6 months (had only just arrived). Although when I asked if he spoke english, he responded with a huffy "Of course!". He also tried to instruct me on how to eat my mango, which I already knew how. Just a little pretentious :P

Beyond that, the bus ride went smoothly, I did some reading, wrote a blog post, watched some movies, and nearly puked when we were going through the pass. I got some serious vertigo and for about 45 minutes was working on my prana breathing (yoga people, is that the right term?). Huaraz is at 10,000ft and needless to say, I have had a small headache since I got here. The area outside of Lima, was pretty much a desert wasteland, not even cactus grows there. The cliffs on the coast were amazingly breathtaking. Josh got some pictures, but I wasn't able to. After this the desert becomes more lush, but even in Huaraz it is a dry place. The last bit of the bus ride was super sketchy though, as the road was very dark with lots of potholes. Speeding through the dark, dodging potholes like a go-cart driver, in a double-decker bus is enough to give anyone a start! We arrived fine though, got our bags, got to the hotel, and ate some food. I tried Guinea Pig, or Cuy, a specialty in the area from a French restaurant (also got veggies, thank god). Cuy was quite delicious, I'll definitely try it in other places. After that we returned back to our hotel where we all promptly passed out!
