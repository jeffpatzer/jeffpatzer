Today was our first full day in Huaraz (pronounced waaraz), and it was really interesting.  Read more about the city here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huaraz  This is a very nice high-altitude town full of lots of markets and sun! No really, it was about 80degrees today. The entirety of the town center can be walked around and the outskirts only take about 10 mins to reach by foot. We are staying in a nice hotel close to the Plaza de Armas (city center). We can walk to get cheap food all over. 

We had a meeting with the Specialist this morning. We reviewed our jobs and what we will be doing. Hosh will be spending two weeks at a time in a village, living with the teachers. I will be staying in Huaraz and each day traveling to the villages, until about Oct 4 when I too will begin to stay out in the villages. The reason we are staying in the villages is because they are too far away to bus to and from in one day. For this first week, I'll be getting up at 5am on Mon and Tues to leave with the teachers. Wed is a field day, where I can play soccer with the kids, or whatever else game they want. Thurs and Fri I'll be traveling to a school close to Huaraz. It's really exciting to know that work is starting. While I enjoy being a tourist, I need purpose! The hardest part of this whole thing is going to be working in spanish all day. Voy a saber el idioma muy bien despues de este trabajo!

After our meeting, we strolled around the town. I got a picture of this little girl carrying a puppy, soooo cuttteeee! Hope got a haircut for about 1.80$. Now that is cheap! We then strolled through the market, where they have vegetables, random other stuff, and DEAD ANIMALS! Lots of ducks, pigs, cow tongues, and GUINEA PIGS! I love developing country markets, they make me want to be a veg! After the market, we strolled back to our hotel. Hope stayed there while Josh and went to hunt down a better map of the areas that we would be going to. We discovered that since the area we were heading to is not a tourist area, there are no maps. To combat this lack of direction, we will each be accompanying the teacher to their school. Should be an adventure, because not only do we have to take long bus rides, but these are accompanied with long walks (30 mins +).

After this we relaxed at the hotel for a bit, then went to get dinner at a pizza place. It was okay, definitely not a Pizzaiolo, but it did the job. We then ventured into a pool hall, which was full of young teenage guys, beyond the lady at the front desk Hope was the only other girl. We took an hour to play one game because the holes for the balls were about half the size of standard ones (why? I don't know, but thats why it took an hour). Josh and I had to stare down a couple guys who were eyeing Hope in a not so flattering manner. They soon stopped as they recognized the physical superiority that Josh and I possess (right?). After the pool hall we went back to the hotel to wait for the clubs to open (think 11pm +). We then visited the Zion Bar (Reggae Vibe) and then went to a Karaoke bar, where Josh and I wooed them with "Let it Be" by the Beatles. The whole place was thoroughly entertained by our off-key rendition! After this, we called it a night and returned back to our hotel to pass out :)
