I'm going to try a format that is a bit different, instead of posting a daily post for the past few days that I was out of contact, I will post it all in one post with sections for each day.

<strong>Tuesday 10-5: 6 hour bus ride</strong>

On Tuesday I was at the bus stop at 730am. I met the teacher I would be traveling with and we boarded a bus. The bus finally left around 830am. I feel the bus deserves a bit of a description. In an effort to pack as many people as possible into this bus, all large bags were placed on the top under a tarp (although this barely helps with the dust). Medium bags fill the aisle, these are things like bags of grain, dog food, and other smelly items I couldn't identify. Small bags are stowed in the above rack, or if they won't there (mine didn't), then they go on you lap. At this point I had no idea that it would be a 6 hour bus ride. Either way, the bus trundled along its way, and after about 2 hours past all the sights that I knew. We continued past the furthest town I had yet visited, Pira, and up into the hills. At this point the teacher I was traveling with made hand motions that indicated we would be traveling over the hills and beyond. I smiled and nodded my head, all the while thinking "Are you serious?". The road itself was enough to make me crap myself. It is a dirt track barely large enough for the bus (albeit a small bus) to navigate, with a several hundred foot drop present on one side at all times. Either way we eventually made it to the town of Pampas Grande (described in earlier weeks by locals as "muy lejos" or extremely far, I now know why). We had a lunch of rice and potatoes, and they set me up in a room adjacent to the church. I was then left to my own devices. I played soccer with the locals at 5 or so, had a dinner of rice and potatoes, and contented myself to reading a book in my room. 

*Interesting tid bit, apparently the University of Richmond sends a group of students to Pampas Grande (<a href="http://news.richmond.edu/as/features/prehealth_peru.html"/>Article from UofR</a>, read the article about the description town, its a bit more rosy than my interpretation) every year in April to teach the kids english and to do other community related projects. The locals thought that was where I was from. I kindly corrected them that no I was not from there, no it was not close to california, and no I also wasn't a tourist (if I was, I'd be at Machu Pichu people). I explained I was working with laptops and schools, they seemed to understand.

<strong>Wednesday 10-6: Chorillos</strong>

On Wednesday, I was up at 6am and ready to go by 7. The teacher showed up at my room, and we did the 45min walk to the school. It was a small school of only about 12 students. They only had enough laptops for the six older students, so since there were about 4 grades in the class, I worked with the older kids so the teacher could work with the younger kids. The older kids (about 6 of them), were actually quite proficient at the laptops. However, like most students, they lacked extensive knowledge about activities. This includes the ability to search in wikipedia, how to highlight, change the size, color, font, and alignment of text in the writing activity, how to share an activity or create their own sets of flashcards. However, this group of students seemed to catch on quickly and we were able to make use of our only day together. After school, the teacher and myself trotted back to town (45mins, half uphill, think goat path). I ate lunch, and was reading a book, when I was interrupted by a yelling drunk (see video) in the town square. He kept it up for about 2 hours. I spent the rest of the afternoon reading a spanish book loaned to me by Josh (Breaking out of beginner's spanish by Joseph Keenan). 

A thing to note, the town of Pampas Grande is at about 12000ft. This means that at night, it gets really cold. I was wearing a hat, and multiple layers while in my room. Being inside didn't make all that much difference.

<strong>Thursday 10-7: No motorcycle = 2 hour walk to San Juan</strong>

Thursday I was up at 6am, ready by 7am, and at the teacher's house by 720am. The reason for this is that I was going to be visiting another school that day that was much farther away. The teacher was supposed to help me catch a motorcycle going in that direction. However, we did not find the moto and consequently I had to walk. We got to Chorillos after about 45mins and the teacher instructed me to keep walking on the road. So I kept walking, and walking, and walking, essentially everytime I reached a crest, I kept seeing more and more road. Eventually I had walked to the edge of the westward facing road, could pretty much see the coast lowlands, and the town was around the bend, facing completely west. After about 2 hours of walking, I was greeted by the teacher and a parent, and saw the moto I had missed parked at the parent's house. The guy said he didn't see us walking, I'm not sure how this could be because there is only one road. Either way, we got to the school and I was told there was only 4 students, and they had not had electricity for 15 days. This meant that none of the laptops had any battery left except mine. So we crowded around my laptop while I proceeded to teach them about searching in wikipedia and changing the text in escribir. Since I had to walk to the village and needed to be back in Pampas Grande by 2pm for the bus back to Huaraz (the next bus wouldn't be until Monday), I only had two hours to work with the kids. This had to include their recess the teach insisted they take. So school was over by noon. That meant it was a 1:1 ratio time walking to time teaching. 

I was fed a lunch of potatoes, rice, AND cuy (guinea pig). I was asked if I knew how to eat cuy (Yes Senora, I do) and if eating this food would kill me (No Senora, I think I will live). They seemed to find this funny. After lunch I got a ride back on the moto (YES) and packed my things to catch the bus. This time the ride was only 5 hours back because it more downhill than uphill. However, since the bus was much less crowded (by the way it was exactly the same bus) more bags went inside. Now, you are thinking, "Oh that's nice, less dust". And you'd be right, to a point. However, it was not for dust, but rather to make room on the roof for the pig and sheep that needed to go on the top of the bus. Now, if you've never watched (and heard) a pig and sheep hoisted up by ropes, then you are really missing something. The sound made by the pig gave new meaning to the phrase "Squeal Piggy". The sheep was more docile, hanging like a limp duck as it was raised by its neck. After these antics, the bus go on its way.

Over the course of the trip, more passengers were picked up and the pig almost escaped. We had to stop (which was a plus so that I could pee) to retie the piggy. The sheep just behaved and didn't do anything. I can't imagine having to ride on top of the bus for 5 hours through cold and dust. Either way, got back to Huaraz and met back up with Hosh. Did my typical long shower routine and got some chicken for dinner. 

Overall a short week of work, but definitely full of adventure. Next week I'll be back in the same area, but walking to schools farther away. Good thing I'm in shape :)
