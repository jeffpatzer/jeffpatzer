Today was pretty easy going. We woke up kind of late and spent the early part of the morning going over our XO's and material that we will need to know for tomorrow's training at the ministry. We went for a late lunch at a Backpacker kitchen for a fixed meal (price of 10$). I got the ceviche for the appetizer and "cau cau" for the main dish. For those of you who don't know, like I didn't, "cau cau" is actually cows stomach. It wasn't too bad, but I don't think that I'll be getting it again :). We had a pear syrupy compote for desert, it wasn't too bad. The best part of the meal was actually when I accidentally ate a tomato looking pepper, who soon induced a 5 minute coughing fit and tear session as my sinuses experienced a serious butt whopping. 

After this I spent a majority of the day fixing my website, the theme got corrupted so I switched to a new one, you like? Josh and Hope (hereon to be described as Hosh), went to Huaca Pullcana which I had already visited. After their return we got dinner and relaxed. We are calling it an early night because tomorrow we have to go to the ministry for training, starting at 830 (meaning an early rise time for the 40 minute cab ride). We're excited to begin the work and are anxious to see what will happen tomorrow. 

Sorry, but I don't have any cool pictures today :( but should have some more soon!
