The first part of the day was slow and easy. We did not have to be on our train to Aguas Calientes until 1230pm, so we spent the morning packing and eating Choclo con Queso, Maize with Cheese. By the time we actually got on the train, there was a slight drizzle, which didn’t let up until much later in the afternoon.

<em>Train Ride</em></p>
<strong>A quick note on the logistics of Machu Picchu, if you aren’t interested, simply skip past this section, but the overall logistics are quite interesting. </strong>Machu Picchu itself is located up a valley that is only accessible two ways: by train or by hiking the Inca Trail. While I have heard rumor that you can take a colectivo, this manner is most likely limited to locals and has been known to be very dangerous. The geography itself demands that there are no roads, plus I think Peru Rail enjoys the monopoly it has over the service. There are two companies that one can take, Peru Rail and Inka Rail. Peru rail is the biggest and most popular, offering multiple types of services and times. There is a highly exclusive level that leaves and returns to Cusco costs about 600$ roundtrip. The next level is slightly more reasonable and leaves and returns to Ollantaytambo for about 180$ roundtrip. The cheapest option, cheerfully dubbed the “Backpackers Train” (really that’s the name, I’m not making it up), leaves and returns to Ollantaytambo for about 63$. Inka rail is about 90$ round trip, with similar service.

The trains themselves don’t go to the site of Machu Picchu. They go to a small town at the base of the mountains, next to the river, called Aguas Calientes or Machu Picchu Pueblo. I think they are trying to rebrand to the latter, but are not having much success since everyone I talk to calls it by the former. AG is a town built almost exclusively to serve tourists on their way to MP. There are places to eat, places to stay, and places to shop. Not much else. The good thing is that if you are in the low season, haggling is extremely easy, as all the restaurants and hostels are fighting for business.

The tickets for MP have to be bought in AG and cannot be purchased at the entrance to MP. The tickets are 44$ for adults, or half that for students. To get to MP, one can either do the 1.5hr walk up to the entrance or pay the 7$ (expensive by Peruvian standards) to take a 15min bus up. Buses run from AG up to MP about every 15 minutes, after the initial morning rush. The first buses leave around 530am, which means if you want a decent spot you have to arrive about 45 minutes early to line up to get on the bus. You have to buy a bus ticket before getting on the bus and can either buy a roundtrip ticket, or a one way. If you are in decent shape you can hike up and hike back, but Liz and I decided to only hike back (downhill is so much easier).

Once you get to MP you have to queue up to get into the site. The guards come down the line asking if you’d like a ticket to climb Huanay Pichu (the mountain behind MP). They only allow 400 people total to do this a day, so if you are not early, you can’t get a ticket to do this. Many people hiking the Inca Trail cannot get these tickets during the high season because they arrive a bit after the bus crowd has arrived. In fact, to get a decent spot and be there early enough to avoid crowds, one has to stay in AG to get up to MP early enough. If you come on morning trains, you don’t arrive until around 10am, and if you hike, you still don’t arrive until about 630-7am. It’s a very convoluted process that took quite a while and many discussions to figure out and decipher. However, once deciphered, you get treated to one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. <strong>Now back to the main story.</strong>

The train ride is very scenic as it slowly tracks farther into the mountains. The hills rise up vertically, reminding one of Jurassic Park (or Kauai if you’ve actually been there, which is where Jurassic Park was filmed). The area is known as a cloud forest and is extremely green (stark contrast to the Cordillera Negra). Besides the scenery, the only other memorable thing about the ride was the coffee, which was atrocious. Absolutely atrocious!

<em>Peruvian Countryside</em></p>
Once in AG, you disembark and are immediately bombarded by people trying to get you to come eat at a restaurant, stay at a hostal, buy copied painting prints, or any other myriad of things. The entrance to the train station is surrounded by an artisan market, which means to actually get through the town you have to slug your way through a series of stalls and people trying to get you to buy useless crap. Once Liz and I had made it through these various layers, we set off to buy our Machu Picchu tickets and find a place to stay. We were able to swing the student price with our old Cal student IDs for the tickets, which was half-off. This was pretty cool. After this we went on the hunt for a hostal, which turned out to be quite easy. Once one wanders out of the plaza and into the backstreets, one can encounter a myriad of places all looking to serve your needs. Originally Liz and I had planned on camping, but due to the rain we decided against this. We are both familiar with sleeping in a tent in the rain and needless to say, unless forced, it is not something we would willingly do.

Once we found a place with the appropriate price and amenities, we went for a walk around the small town. We had a late lunch, which actually ended up costing us less and having free Pisco sours. Although the restaurants in the town try to charge a service fee, when I saw this on the check, I told the waitress we were not going to pay it. She tried to lower it, but I said that we would pay no service fee, none. She gave up fairly easy which makes me think they just try to do that to get more money from people that don’t look at the check. On a side note, it is not customary to tip in Peru, which is why I argued the fee.
After lunch we got food from the market (which is surprisingly well-stocked) for dinner. We looked at some of the shops and generally killed time throughout the day. The town can be walked end-to-end in about 10 minutes, so it is not entirely the largest place. After our exploring, we returned to the hotel to pack and prepare for the big day at Machu Picchu the following day.
