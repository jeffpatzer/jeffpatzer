Yesterday, Nov 21, was a day spent walking around Trujillo. We explored much of the central area, taking in the architecture and chatting with the various people that approached us. We even ventured to the modern mall they have just outside the main downtown area. This was like stepping into a time warp to the future. I did not realize how accustomed I had become to the bustling market areas filled with vendors, until we were walking around a clean, sterile mall with periodic consumerism announcements regarding sales. A real shock.

A night we met some more of Abraham's friends, but did not stay out too late. We had a bus to catch today that trucked us back to Lima. The ride was about 9 hours long and not too exciting. Much of the Peruvian countryside is a desert, which leaves much to be desired for scenery.

The hostal we choose though is close to the ministry, with whom we have a meeting tomorrow morning. We have to present about our experience and turn in all our reports. We hope it goes well, considering some of the things we have to say are a bit critical. However, after this presentation we will be officially done with the OLPC internship and will become full-time tourists!
