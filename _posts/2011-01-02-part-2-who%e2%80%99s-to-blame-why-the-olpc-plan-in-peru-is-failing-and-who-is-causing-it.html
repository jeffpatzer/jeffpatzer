This is part 2 of a 6 part series that critically examines my experience in Peru and the situation I encountered.

<em><strong>Note</strong>: I am a graduated engineer that has been taught to think through problems and search for solutions. I am not an expert on Peru and I do not pretend to be. I am drawing on my own experiences and interpretations. My observations span twenty schools and countless interactions with the ministry and teachers over a period of approximately three months. In addition, I often refer to Hope and Josh, but I do not speak for their opinions.</em>

The interns over the summer had been subject to a week of training at the ministry of education in preparation for their jobs. We had been provided “training” over the summer by our volunteer supervisor. These trainings had consisted of long periods of time talking about laptop basics (i.e. taking a picture, pasting it into the write activity) via internet chat. Apparently, the interns over the summer had been much less technical savvy, and he was under impression that the fall group was the same. This was not the case. Two of us are engineers and the other a very savvy philosophy major. Over the summer there had been two engineers and ten teaching interns. The type of training we required was quite different. We probably would have been better served by discussing the teaching being done in the classes. At no point was the actual lesson plans being used in the class rooms discussed. Rather we discussed abstract concepts like the purpose of the laptop (a tool to help kids learn). While knowing the basics of the laptop functions is nice, it would have been preferable to learn ways to implement the laptops in the classroom.

<em>Helping the students</em></p>
Due to our “training” over the summer, we were to only have one day of training at the ministry. Therefore upon our arrival at the ministry, we assumed that we would be trained in how to implement the laptops with the class. However, for the whole first half of the day we spent the time with two different ladies. They continually talked about how our job was to convince the teachers to use the laptops. We were to be creative in figuring out ways to make the teachers utilize the laptops, because as we were told many did not want to. The other topic they discussed was how proud they were of their indigenous population. While this is a noble topic, it had almost no bearing on teaching with the laptop. The only teaching parts we discussed were how to make books in eToys and how to connect to each other’s laptops using the mesh network.

The major positive part of our training was we were given a copy of the Peru software image, which is needed to flash the machines. Apparently flashing the machines is the only method of fixing any problems related to the software and any hardware problems should just be reported. Along with this software image we were also shown how to change the name and colors of the little XO person for the laptops. While you would think this should be easy, it is not. Rather one has to open up the terminal activity and manually enter a series of English commands. Not only is use of the terminal out of any teacher’s technical grasp, but so is English commands, even ones that are copied.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Concept Maps by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5084589796/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5084589796_40c0ab6e8f_z.jpg" alt="Concept Maps" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Concept Maps</em></p>
To avoid having laptops stolen, each laptop is activated using a key that lasts for the duration of the year. This key is included in the software image and part of the flashing process. While in theory this key should kick in and work fine, the laptops’ internal clocks often get out of sync. This means the laptop thinks it is Feb 2008 or some other random date, rather than the current date. This causes the laptop to shut down and no longer allow functioning, rendering the machine useless.

Essentially the key points of our jobs would be to convince teachers to use the laptops and to be glorified laptop software flashers. When OLPC originally described this job, I was supposed to be installing Servers and SatLinks to provide Internet to schools, fixing software bugs, or replacing broken hardware parts. It was turning out that my job was going to be much different than originally promised.
