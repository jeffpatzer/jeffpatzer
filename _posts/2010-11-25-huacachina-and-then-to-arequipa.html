**Pictures are to come, I haven't had enough time to go through them yet :)

Today we spent the day in the sleepy, desert oasis of Huacachina. The town itself was originally built for Peruvian elite as a weekend getaway place. However, now it has become more of a tourist party destination for young people. The bars blare music late into the night and things are slow to start in the morning. We decided to relocate to a different hotel for the day where we could get a better deal on the day’s activities.

On a side note, I’d just like to provide some information for any that travel to Huacachina, since most guidebooks have almost no information on the place. While going to the town in a cab, the cabby will suggest a place to stay if you do not have one. You can go to this place, but understand he is being paid to bring you there. You can inquire about the prices and then politely leave and look for other accommodation. What one must realize is that the lagoon is studded with places to stay, eat, and relax. Don’t just settle on the first one. For instance, Casa de Arena, is a nice place for a pool, but their rooms are dirty, hot, and too well-used. Plus, they are more expensive both for their room prices and their buggy/sandboarding excursions. It has the feel of a factory. However, with just a short walk down the street, you can find places to camp, other hotels, and better deals on excursions. We found a very accommodating place called Bananas Lodge that was cheaper, cleaner and with nicer clientele. The moral here is, don’t just settle, but look around for other options. Also, most places for Huacachina are not listed online or in guide books, but once there you can find many, many options.

Once arranging our day’s activities, which would be a sunset Dune Buggy and Sandboarding tour, we relaxed by the pool and drank fresh, frozen juices. We actually ended up meeting some very nice Peace Corps (Piece Core according to one of their shirts :P) who were actually working in Caraz, which is just down the street from Huaraz. It was great to compare stories and experiences. They ended up accompanying us on the buggy tour later in the day.

The buggy tour itself is extremely fun. The buggies are rolling cages that scream up and down the surrounding dunes. They whisk you to the top, where you can slide down the face on a wooden plank, then pick you up at the bottom only to take you to the next dunes and do it all over again. The actual boarding is great fun. You get much more speed by laying on your stomach, and covering the bottom of the board in wax. The only trick is to keep you elbows tucked, so as not to have your hair and possibly skin removed by the high speed. I really recommend the 2.5 hour excursion to watch the sunset, be driven through sand dunes, and then slide down them at mach speed. Liz found out the hard way what falling means, sand everywhere. Everywhere!

After the ride, we took a shower, and jumped in a cab to the bus station. We boarded our bus to take us to Arequipa. Liz and I will spend the next couple of days taking in the city and arranging a tour, we’re thinking a couple day hiking trip, to the Colca Canyon. The Colca Canyon is actually deeper than the Grand Canyon, but not as steep. Overall, traveling through Peru is turning out being a lot easier than traveling to the various rural schools of Ancash. Oh yeah, HAPPY TURKEY DAY. I’m thankful for dune buggies and sand boards, what are you thankful for?
