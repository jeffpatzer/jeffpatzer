Today I was up at 6am and ready at the school doors by 7am. The problem was the teacher was still asleep. So I hung outside the school for about 15 minutes eating an orange until he opened the gates. I dropped my stuff, washed my face and hair (remember no showers) which temporarily tricks me into thinking that I am clean, and we went to go eat breakfast. 
Breakfast consisted of a rice, potatoes, some corn, cafesito (black sugary water), and soup. Fairly standard fare. Before school started, the teacher asked me if the laptops could connect to the internet, I said yes, then he asked if I could show him how. So I showed him and showed him in the large manual provided by the ministry of education exact instructions. I don’t think that he had read much of the manual. Once again, it is the case that the laptops are being used at about 50% of their capacity. 

I worked with the kids from 8-1 in the activity eToys, making concept maps and books. When we stopped for recess around 1030 the teacher once again started pestering me about money and even flat out asked me how much I had in my bank account. Awkward. Either way, we had a two hour break at 1pm for lunch. We started again from 3-5 where we worked on charlar and scratch (my first group to do this with). At the end of the day the teacher told the students how lucky they were to have me and how I was paying for everything on my own. This surprised me, the paying for myself part, because this shed a new light on his money questions. For all I know he could have been asking these questions because he was concerned about me. So while I did feel awkward about his questions, it made me see them in a new light. 

Also, this teacher called me by a new title, Engineer. I get a butchered form of my name (from parents and teachers) or professor from the kids, but this was the first time I got Engineer or Ingeniero in Spanish. 

After school, I returned to my room to relax for a bit. At some point one of the students came to retrieve me for dinner. Dinner consisted of cancha, which is about half-popped popcorn, and some soup. There was also cafesito to top it off. While the food lacked much luster, the questions were interesting. They family, who I’d eaten dinner and breakfast with before, finally opened up and started talking. They were mostly curious about English and how long it took to get here in a plane. This tends to be the usual fare or questions, however I got a different spin tonight that took me by surprise. As I was explaining how it could only take 12 hours and how it wasn’t bumpy (remember all transportation here is by dirt road in a car or bus stuck in the armpit of the person next to you), one person asked how close to the moon we flew. Now think about that for a second, you live a life where the concept of the distance to the moon has never been explained. I was floored by the statement, but most of all, reminded why the kids and the all the people in general needed the laptops for things like Wikipedia. Where they can look up information that will completely change the way they view the world. 

Also, in case you are wondering, about whether or not I feel guilty about having more than a lot of these people, I do not. Now before you fire up the email to write me a strongly worded message, hear me out. My feelings on the subject of my relative wealth versus theirs, and the amount of wealth available in the world in general, is that the pie isn’t finite. One cannot think of the amount of prosperity as finite, because it isn’t. In fact, I think the pie is ever expanding. And the more education and knowledge you provide the faster it will expand. So while I do have more than these people, my work doesn’t make me feel guilty about this, but gives me hope that one day they can have the same sort of “wealth” that I am lucky enough to have. While that sounds optimistic, I can’t think of any other way of phrasing it. So kids, next time your parents tell you eat your waffles because children in Africa are starving, tell them that your food going to waste won’t help them, but having your parent’s donate to help education in Africa will :P (Dear parents, please don’t hate me for that).
