Well today was interesting. I met my other two interns Josh and Hope, who I'll be spending the next couple months with. They arrived in the morning after a long red-eye flight and promptly went to sleep. Around noon Josh and myself, Hope deciding to sleep, took a cab into Lima Centro and went to see the sights downtown. We saw a couple plazas that had some parades/processions going on there. Then we visited the Inquisition Museum (museum de inquiscion) and the San Francisco church. Both were interesting, but the most interesting thing had to be the crypts in the church. They were full of bones of people who had been buried there. After the church, Josh and I made our way up into Chinatown and through the market. It was a good opportunity to talk with and get to know Josh. After this we caught a Taxi back to our Hostel and headed out to find dinner. We had Arabic food, which wasn't too bad. Food here is quite cheap. You can get a meal for about 10 soles or about 3.50$. 

For dinner we had a surfer guy join us from the hostel who has spent the better part of his adult life working as a tree planter in canada during the summer (he's from canada, eh?) and then surfing in south america during the winter. He has lots of interesting stories, of course. After dinner we returned to the hostel for some darts, foosball (which I dominated in, YEAH!), and a game of bananagrams (like scrabble). I won both of those games too (YEAH!). Then we went to have a late night snack and are now exhausted!

Not quite as much espanol as yesterday, but still quite a bit!
