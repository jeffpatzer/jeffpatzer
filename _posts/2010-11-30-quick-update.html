We spent the last 3 days in the Colca Canyon. Today we are going around Arequipa looking at the city and tonight are taking a bus to Puno. I will be able to give a proper post and update with pictures tomorrow once in Puno. But now everyone can know that Liz and I are safe and alive. Also, Liz is bored and doesn't like me playing on my computer all day (although I don't mind so much).
