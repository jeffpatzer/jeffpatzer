This morning I got up (Sep 3) at 3am for the drive to LAX for my 920am flight. I think this is the first time I can say that my parents dogs were woken up by me instead of the other way around. My flight was two legs, the first one from LAX to Houston and the second from Houston to Lima. The best part about this was that my connections were at the same gate so I didn't have to go anywhere. Each flight was packed, but it didn't hinder the flight experience. I worked on the XO laptop most of the time, playing with the programs and building a game with one of them (the brick smashing one).  The flights went really quick it seemed and I have to commend the folks at Continental for being awesome. They were really professional and everything went down without a hitch. I gladly recommend them to anybody else.

Once I arrived in Lima it was the customary long wait in customs for the guy to spend 20 seconds just giving me stamps. Seriously, no questions, nothing, just STAMP, STAMP, buenos noches! I think I wowed him with my "Hola" upon approaching the counter that he knew I could be trusted. After this got in the cab the hostel sent, whereupon the driver began to speak extremely quick spanish, then wait patiently while I bumbled through a response. I had as much a hard time speaking spanish because I was holding on for dear life as the driver weaved his way in and out of traffic like a go-cart driver. I don't know how we didn't crash as we were careening down the street at mach-10, blinkers flashing, horn honking, and talking at the same time. Skillz!
