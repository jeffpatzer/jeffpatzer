Today Hosh and me were invited to the teacher from Racrao's mother-in-laws restaurant for a birthday celebration of an uncle. The restaurant is located right next to the trout farm in the city. Seriously, its a trout farm where they raise fish for consumption in the area. The only problem is that they only way Peruvians cook their fish is fried, or Trucha Frita, which defeats the purpose of the tasty trout in my opinion. Anyways, we did not eat Trout despite our proximity to the farm, but rather were served duck. The ducks that I had help pack up three days ago. Along with the duck was potatoes and rice (I swear its in every Peruvian dish). The duck itself was not the most tasty I've ever had and I think I much prefer Liz's Grandma's recipe. I ate all the duck though and everything else. I have no fear, plus I don't want to be rude. Our main course was followed by a serving of two deserts!  We sang Happy Birthday, in English, which threw me off, but luckily I knew the words. This makes me think of all the wasted time learning to sing that song in Spanish. Bleh! Luckily Deserts, Peruvians know how to get right. After lunch we all were sent into a comatose due to all the food. Overall quite an enjoyable afternoon. 

I leave to go back into the field tonight and won't be back until Friday most likely. It's a 3 hour bus ride tonight, plus a few more hours tomorrow morning. I'll take great notes so that I can provide inspiring and comical posts next weekend :)
