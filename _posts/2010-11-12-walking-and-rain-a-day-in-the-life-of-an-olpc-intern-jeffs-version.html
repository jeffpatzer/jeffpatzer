Hope originally wrote a version of her experience as an OLPC intern, which I <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2010/10/29/guest-post-by-hope-and-josh/" target="_self">reproduced on my site</a>.

I’m jolted awake this morning by my cell phone ringing, it the cheapest Chinese model I could buy and the ringtone is equally as cheap. I think it is only my alarm so I am slow to get it. However as I blearily stare at the phone, searching for the button to cease the terrible sound (the ringer) from interrupting what had been great sleep, I see that it is actually a call. I answer the phone “Hola?” On the other end I am asked if this is “Señor Jeffrey”, I reply that yes it is, and soon the other person explains that he is the teacher of Tinyash and “Am I supposed to be going with him today to his school?” I reply that I am. He then asks me, “How do you normally get to the schools, by car or walking?” I think back to my hike the morning before and quickly answer, “Walking,” I answer emphatically. This question does not strike me odd at the moment. We agree to meet in 45 minutes, or at least I think that is what he said. Sometimes I am not sure, talking on the phone in another language is always a challenge. This call is a bit of a surprise, because I had not heard from this teacher the day before about whether or not I would be going with him. As a result I had not really planned for it and had been up a bit later than a 6am wake-up call makes comfortable. This thought passes through my mind in an instant, only to be removed because I am soon throwing things into my bag at breakneck speed. As I put the XO into my backpack I lament not having charged it the night before. The battery is essentially dead because the last school I was at had no electricity, but I figure I can charge it at the school.

I don’t have time for breakfast because I opt to wash my face. I rush to the Combi station without anything in my stomach. The only thing I know at this moment is that the school I am supposed to be going to is close to Huaraz. The teacher and I meet up; he’s a genial, young looking fellow in good shape. We jump in a Combi and are soon speeding out of town at breakneck speed, which is also the only speed Combis know how to drive at. I am sitting in the seat closest to the door. This turns out to be a terrible mistake as I soon find out. Combis routinely stop to pick up more passengers waiting on the side of the road, and each time we stop I get stepped over receiving the business end of somebody’s rear-end. Luckily the Combi is soon full and it makes no more stops. The teacher and I are let off after only about 15 minutes in the Combi, probably an all time low for me, and I am relieved to see the town right next to the road. I think to myself, Awesome, no walking! As I begin trotting towards the town, the teacher grabs my attention and motions that we are to walk in the other direction. I’m not yet worried.

We cross the river that runs through the valley over and as I step over the saggy, old, creaky, wood boards that are also as holey as Swiss cheese,  my heart rate increases a bit. Only seeing a massive hill in front of me, I ask the teacher, his name is Jony as I have found out by this point, where are we going or “Adonde vamos?” He points to the top of the hill and says “A la punta, arrrrrriiiiiibbbba” (they lengthen a word to increase the emphasis) or translated, “To the top, waaaayyyyy up there”. I think, “F*&amp;k!” Then, as if knowing this isn’t enough, I query “How long will it take to walk there?” Jony cruelly chuckles and tells me that it will take 1.5 hours, but we’re going the fast way, so it will only take an hour. I think “Double F*&amp;k! But how kind of him to take the fast route.” The question of whether or not I walk to schools comes flashing back to my mind. Ah hah, so that is why he asked me that.

We begin ascending which at best could be called a path but is more aptly described as something a mountain goat would be at home walking on. I lift one foot in front of the other and within 5 minutes I am huffing and puffing. This could be due to the altitude of 3100meters, or it could be due to the vertical face we are scaling. To help myself with the walk, I focus on the ground in front of me and try not to look at the massive hill in front of me. After about 30 minutes we’ve reached a town called San Juan. We get a short reprieve as the ground levels out. However, I then look up and see that we still have even more hill to scale. I sigh in resignation, ignore the hunger in my stomach, tighten my shoes and pack, and keep trudging on.

The walk soon turns back into a goat path and I realize that the short path we are taking should not be described as shorter, but steeper. Jony and I get to chatting and he tells me he does this every day. He says sometimes his knees hurt. Really? I wonder why that is. I tell him he should buy trekking poles, 25$ in the market, to help him scale the hill. He thinks this is a good idea and wonders why he did not think of it in the prior 3 years that he had been working here. I think the same thing. As our hike continues on, my lungs begin to burn like a hot iron. The air is so thin, my legs do not have the time to get tired before my lungs run out of air. Jony is understanding of my feeble conditioning (and I consider myself in decent shape) and we stop periodically so I can recover my vision. Our journey continues on for some time, I have stopped thinking about when it will be over and only concentrate on the five feet in front of me. I do this to both to steel myself from giving up and also because my vision blurs from oxygen deprivation past this distance.

After about 1.25 hours, we reach the school. We have probably ascended about 1100 meters and my shirt has become completely soaked. I lament my decision of wearing the only clean clothes I had left. I now realize that the description “close to Huaraz” had been somewhat of a lie. Yes, the ride in the combi was close and quick, but the walk turned into a cruel test of endurance. I tear my shirt off and replace it with my jacket, placing the shirt on a set of rocks to dry. The only food I have with me is peanut butter, so I eat a couple scoops since I find out none of the parents are bringing us breakfast. This helps to calm the talking that my stomach is doing in protest of not having anything in it. I push the hunger out of my mind by ignoring it.

Jony tries to switch the lights to the school on and finds that nothing happens. Apparently, there had not been any electricity for the last couple of days in the town. There are a few thoughts that go through my mind at this point, and it is worth relating them: “Wish I had charged my XO the night before,” “I hope the kids have charged laptops,” “We’ll work in pairs and turn the screen brightness down to prolong battery life,” “I’m only here for a day and it’s the day they have no electricity, haha,” and what I think is the most important “Are you f*&amp;king serious!?” Nevertheless, I take this set-back in stride and group the kids into pairs and have them turn down the brightness of the screens. We have only 3 laptops with charged batteries for 7 students, I pray it will be long enough for the day.

We launch into the workshops, the same ones I do with almost every school, and are soon copying text and photos from the Wikipedia activity and pasting them into the Writing activity. I have yet to encounter any school that really knows how to use the clipboard, and Tinyash is no exception. I always have them copy the picture of Machu Pichu and the text surrounding it from the Peru article and then to reiterate the lesson we copy the picture of people playing soccer and the text surrounding it from the Futbol article. The students always like these articles, plus I know what is in them. After this workshop we move on to the Memory activity. This activity allows us to play a card matching game for addition, letters, and sounds, but most importantly we can create our own games. We create a game about animals with the animal’s name in Spanish and its English translation.

<em>Creating their own game in Memorizar</em></p>
The students as I find out speak more Quecha, a local indigenous language, then they do Spanish and they shout names of animals in Quecha at me. I tell them I do not understand Quecha and to speak in Spanish. They remember this for about a minute and then relapse back to Quecha. It is a continual process of me reminding them and them relapsing.

Around 10am we break for recess and the kids rush out to play. I am always happy for this break as much as they are. The teacher and I trudge into another room of the school where we warm up milk to make hot chocolate to eat with the few bread rolls he has. I must interrupt the story at this point to describe Peruvian bread rolls or Pancito (little bread). It is a mixture of water and flour, more water than flour. It has no flavor and only slightly more substance. It is a staple for most Peruvians. They love it. I do not. Every time I eat one, only because I am hungry, I think longingly of German bakeries full of all types of bread and pastries. After our snack, Jony shows me around the school grounds. He shows me a room they have full of normal PC computers, which do not work because the building was built badly and as a result, when it rained it ruined the wiring in the floor. None of the computers can now work because they have no electricity, so they simply sit unused and gathering dust.

After my tour of the grounds we gather the kids back up and I launch into my next part of the workshops. After having created the memory game, we now share it through the mesh and play against each other.

<em>Playing Memorizar through the Mesh network</em></p>
I watch at these kids struggle with the idea of the game. They often click on the same cards over and over, hoping they will eventually match. I frustratingly explain over and over the idea of looking for pairs, however this does not seem to compute and they futilely continue their course of action. After playing the game for a bit we change tack and I begin to teach them the basics behind the Scratch activity.

<em>Jony helping his students</em></p>
We make a simple project where the cat walks in circles meowing at the same time. They love listening to the cat meow. I make sure to add the sound last, because once it is there they continue to make the cat walk over and over, causing the meowing sound to play continually. I can only take so much of this before I want to throw the computers against the wall while laughing maniacally.

Once we have finished making this project it is almost the end of the day and only one computer has any battery left. I gather the kids around the last computer standing. The kid controlling the computer gives me attitude when I ask him to open the Browser activity. He thinks he is being funny as he says he does not know how. Thinking he is a smart little fellow, I switch to English and begin to say nothing in particular “I’m speaking to you in English, you don’t understand me, it will make you uncomfortable…” etc. His smile soon disappears from his face and as further punishment I give the laptop to another kid who will listen. Since I cannot discipline them, often times taking the laptop and speaking in English is the only recourse I have with unruly kids.

In the browser activity is a series of pictures of famous things from around the world. Things like the Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, and a Great White shark, to name a few. I like to show them the photos to help them think about other parts of the world. Soon though our time is up, which also coincides with the death of the last laptop.

<em>One of the students before I had to leave</em></p>

<em>Same student, she loved the camera</em></p>
I change back into my original shirt for the walk back down the mountain. As I stare across the valley at the Cordillera Blanca, I see a mass of black clouds. I notice the wind is blowing into my face, which means the clouds are coming towards us. I think “Great, now we get to hike down in the rain.”
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Rain on the horizon by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5176439624/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/5176439624_5443c5af6b_z.jpg" alt="Rain on the horizon" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Rain on the horizon</em></p>
Jony and I take off at breakneck speed, essentially running down the hill we had scaled earlier that morning. After about 10 minutes the rain begins in a medium downpour. Despite my jacket (which is supposed to be somewhat water proof), I am soon soaked to the skin. Slipping and sliding our way across rocks and mud on a 60% incline, we make the descent in only about 40 minutes. When we are finally at the road standing waiting for a Combi, my legs are quivering from the sprint down the hill, I’m shivering from the rain, and as I look up at the sky, the rain stops. Seriously?

Within about 5 minutes we’ve waived down a Combi and have piled in along with the 17 other people (in the 12 passenger vehicle) for the short ride back to Huaraz. Jony and I are seated in the front seats and as time wears on, the windshield becomes fogged up due to the moisture. The driver switches on his defroster which promptly accomplishes, nothing. So he takes to wiping his windshield with an old dirty rag, holding the wheel with one hand and wiping with the other. My life is completely out of my hands. He punctuates this wiping with handing change back to the people as they pay him, one hand wiping, one hand giving change, one hand driving. Do the math and it will all make sense.

We arrive back in Huaraz to be greeted by sunny skies. Jony and I chuckle at our luck, shake hands and part ways. The rest of the afternoon I occupy with a shower, eating, and recovering from my hike this morning. As I lay in bed at night, about to fall asleep and running over the day’s events in my head, Jony’s question about how I get to the schools flashes brightly in my mind, “How do you normally get to the schools, by car or walking?” I smile wearily and think, I get there by walking. I get there by walking.
