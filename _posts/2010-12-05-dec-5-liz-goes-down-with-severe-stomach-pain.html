This Sunday was a relaxation day, partly out of necessity. Liz was experiencing stomach pain a lot of the day. Essentially whenever she ate anything, she felt like knives were wedging themselves into her abdomen. As a result she spent most of the day sleeping, while I visited museums. Eventually she awoke for the afternoon and we meandered over to a bar owned by an American where we watched football (American football, not the type where they run around falling and crying whenever they get close to each other :P). We were able to squeeze in a few hours before we needed to return to the hostal so Liz could get more rest. Overall the day was quiet, I mean Liz was asleep most of the time, and easy-going.

On a side note, the museums I visited were somewhat underwhelming. They were both small, had very little collections, and the pieces they did have were quite mediocre. The two I visited were the Museum of Regional History and the Museum of Popular Art.
