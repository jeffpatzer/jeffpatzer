Hi all

Just a quick update tonight. The last week I've been in "el campo" or translated, the wilderness. More or less I went a week with minimal electricity, no running water, and no showering. I walked about 10 miles over the course of the week with about a weeks worth of provisions on my back to get from school to school. 10 miles isn't that bad, if it were flat. I was hiking up and down small mountains with probably a total elevation change of about 800 feet. 

Anyways, took a shower and ate some good food. I'll do a bunch of back posting with pictures tomorrow :)

Hope all is well with everyone!
