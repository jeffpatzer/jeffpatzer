This week really began on Monday night. Hosh and myself had arrived back in Huaraz around 6am in the morning. We trudged our way to the hotel, and all took a nap until about 10am. While the bus trip from Lima is advertised as a “buss cama” or bed bus, sleeping is minimal at best in my experience. We spent the rest of the day relaxing and working. Around 6pm, I met the teacher with whom I would be traveling and we piled into a combi for the three hour ride to Cajamarquilla. I would be working at the same place all week, since the places I was scheduled to visit were too distant and would have had to walk for too long a period of time (not that that is really much of an issue anymore). Now this particular combi trip was exceptional in that it had to be the MOST CROWDED combi I have ever been on. They should only be able to hold about 14 people, we had 22. In addition, the roof was piled up about 3 feet high with cargo, and the entire inside walkways were filled with bags. Honestly, I could not move an inch. Throw in the fact that the seats have about no padding, which means you are riding on metal bars, and you have a recipe for a very uncomfortable three hours spent on small dirt mountain roads.

Nevertheless, we arrived in Cajamarquilla without a hiccup, thank god, and I was shown to my room. I promptly passed out. I awoke Tuesday morning feeling like someone had kicked me in the stomach. I had a terrible case of bubble guts that would only get worse throughout the day. I rallied, got ready for the day, and by 630am was walking with the teacher up to the school, located in Shipash Huain, a 45 minute walk uphill. By the time we got to the school, of course I had worked up a good sweat in addition to my stomach that would not stop talking. Seriously, it was making noises. I suffered through breakfast, not because the food was bad, but because I had almost no appetite and any bit of food that hit my stomach felt like the equivalent of getting punched. After breakfast, I worked with the kids until 1pm in a couple different activities. The students themselves were typical of most I had encountered. Some were quick to learn while others needed much more help. Usually the ones that understand help the others, which is helpful to me since I work alone. However, the biggest problem with this is that the students who need the help, tend to just become reliant on the help and wait for it, rather than taking initiative. While normally I would not permit this, my time is limited, and I have to make compromises.

During recess, their ball got stuck on the roof of one of the buildings. To get the ball down, and here-in lies the difference between the US and here, we used a piece-mealed ladder propped up on chairs to give it more height. One girl climbed up onto the tin roof, which is not the most structurally safe structure I have ever seen, and grabbed the ball. Never, ever, in a million years, would a kid be permitted to do such a thing in the States. Not only because it’s dangerous, that can be overlooked, but because someone’s lawyer will sue if anything happens. However, if you have only one ball and you live in a place where the only law is that which the community enforces, then it just doesn’t really matter.

We had a quick break for lunch. The teacher made a large amount of food, which I was only able to eat half of before I wanted to curl into a ball and cry like a little girl as my stomach did circles like a washing machine. She understood though, and knew that it didn’t have to do with my dislike of the food. In fact, I was eating better than I had in weeks. We had chicken and vegetables. Of course it makes sense then, that when I get good food, I don’t feel like eating. Typical. We finished up around 430pm, and made the trek back to Cajamarquilla. As soon as we arrived I passed out in my room. I woke for dinner, where I only drank some tea, and then immediately went back to sleep. My sleep was periodically interrupted by the need to use the bathroom (it’s what you think it was, although probably worse), but by the time I woke up the next day at 530am, I felt like a new man. My stomach had stopped hurting and everything felt back to normal. I can only speculate what the cause of this temporary sickness was, but I think it was a combination of altitude (we were at about 3800meters, Lima is 0meters) and the large amount of red meat I had had in Lima. Oh well, all part of the adventure.
