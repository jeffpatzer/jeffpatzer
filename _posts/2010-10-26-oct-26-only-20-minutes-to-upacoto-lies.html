Last night was my first time sleeping on a bed made of hay. I have to say that it was actually quite comfortable and I wouldn’t mind doing it again. I was ready pretty early, because the janitor had shown up early to sweep and clean the school. This is actually kind of a funny idea, considering that when he sweeps the rooms, it really kicks up more dust than anything, which leaves everything coated in dust and the room unbreathable for about 20 minutes.

For the first half of the day I taught the younger kids and did a school-wide workshop after recess. We worked until our batteries were gone.

<em>Pallac</em></p>
I was fed a really good beef soup and lomo saltado (beef with tomatoes, rice, and French fries). One of the teacher’s husbands made it and it was honestly the best soup and lomo I’ve had while in Peru. After lunch I left the school with the teacher’s husband to walk to the town across the canyon, where his motorcycle was parked. He would be giving me a ride to a town somewhat close to where I needed to go. Once we got to Pache, about an 45min walk, we found that a engineer was leaving in a car. I was able to bum a ride with him to the top of the mountain. From the top of the mountain I began walking. I had to walk to Puma (the town has this name for a reason, the area is full of Pumas) and then down to Upacoto.

Before I continue, I must include an interesting conversation that I had with the teacher’s husband. Apparently the teacher who sold me the bus ticket the past Friday, the one who said that bad people live in Pallac and they would rob me, was also the same teacher that got removed from hitting her students. And then, when confronted by parents, hitting them too. So apparently, she wasn’t entirely truthful about the people being bad. Like the teacher’s husband said, “If you are open to the people here, they are open to you. If not, then they won’t be”. I think that this is true everywhere, if only we had the community mentality to deal with the problems like the people of Pallac do.

The walk to Puma was relatively easy. It was all on a road that was mostly flat. It took me a little over an hour.  When I got to Puma, I got directions to Upacoto, which pretty much consisted of “Take that path”. When I asked how long it would take, they said 20mins. This was a lie. I began walking on the path, which quickly turned into something even a goat would have trouble with. The path soon disappeared and I was stuck sliding down a hill on my feet as I made my way towards Upacoto. Eventually, and after about an hour of hill sliding, I was at a point where I could cross the stream/canyon barrier and begin to quickly make my way to Upacoto. The overall trek took about two hours from Puma to Upacoto. Not exactly the 20mins I had been promised.  It was one of the most difficult walks I’ve done so far, although the hike up from Huanlla to Pampas Grande still takes the cake. For full effect, you should watch the video (coming soon).

I arrived at the school, where the teacher was pleasantly surprised to see me. She politely informed me I was a week early. Well I showed her by pulling out my schedule, and the schedule won! Okay, so it wasn’t quite that dramatic, but she was a bit surprised. Nevertheless, she turned out to be one of the nicest teacher’s I’ve met and we moved past this hurdle without a problem. She was even nice enough to give me her room, and she went to stay with one of the parents. Super, super nice. I talked to a bunch of the parents, fielding the usual questions, and then got some dinner. I was so exhausted from my walk, that I promptly passed out after dinner because I was so exhausted. Oh, and for those of you worrying if I was sweaty and dirty, yes, I was. BUT, I rinsed myself in the sink before dinner so that I was a bit more presentable.
