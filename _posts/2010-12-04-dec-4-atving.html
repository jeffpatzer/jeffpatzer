Today Liz and I were up and out the door by 8am for our 9am rendezvous with the ATV tour company. Walking around Cusco the day before Liz had sighted the ATV tour option, and decided that she needed to do that. We had signed up for their half-day tour that would allow us to ride up into the hills around Cusco, and visit a couple tracks. By 930am we had arrived at the starting point. I had chosen to ride a 250cc motorcycle while Liz had opted for the Honda ATV.

We met our guide and were given a few minutes to ride around and get used to the machines. We were given a bare-bones safety talk, a warning that insurance was not provided (although I did get personal insurance with the bike), and a sheet with a list of prices for parts if we broken them. After this we clambered onto the machines and took off up the dirt tracks leading away from Cusco. After a short ride we reached a soccer field where we were allowed to ride in circles. I used this time to see how fast I could get the motorcycle going (fairly quick). After a bit of this, we continued on up the tracks.

After a while of meandering over tracks we arrived at a house where our guide told us we could stop for a break to buy a drink or a snack if we wanted. Liz and I opted to eat the food we had brought with us. At this point our guide got a call on his cell phone from a friend close-by that had crashed. He rushed off to help while we hung out for a bit. During the 20 minute period that he was gone, we were hit by a sudden rain fall. Liz and I remained dry under the overhang, but when our guide got back it appeared he did not have the same luck.
We continued on the roads until we reached a small track where you could ride down a small dip and then scream back up the hill to get some air off a little jump. My only complaint about this was that the machines weren’t geared well enough to get more air. The problem with rental equipment is my guess. After the track we headed back down the hills to the starting point. We were given a coke and some soda crackers for a snack, then piled into a cab back to the main plaza. After having watched Liz ride the quad and see how she was pushing the speed limit, I fear she may become a gearhead! I think this might have been the first time that after a adrenaline activity, she told me she wanted more time to get faster. When I took her mountain biking, she was simply yelling at me because she was scared. But for some reason, give her a quad and she becomes a speed demon :P

We returned back to our hostel and gather our things. We had decided that we would give another hostel a try that night. We hoofed our things to the new place, which was much newer, nicer, and oddly, cheaper. The new place had new bathrooms, new rooms, lots of activities, lots of backpackers, and just much more going on. We dropped our things off, and went in search of a quiet café to work at for a bit. We decided on a place called Los Perros (The Dogs) which had comfy couches, good food, and (most important for Liz) dogs hanging out inside. After the café we returned to the hostel were we relaxed until later that night, when the hostel’s organized party started. Dubbed the “Sexy Circus”, it had a juggling clown, DJ, lights, and all other sorts of entertainment. Liz and I joined in on the festivities for a while, and then decided to go to head off to bed. While the music did play for some time (loudly), the only time I can say that I woke up was when the music shut off. The sudden change woke me up, but I quickly acknowledged the quiet and nodded back off to sleep. I can only imagine how much things must have sucked for the people getting up early for the Inca Trail, but then again, if you knew the place was going to have a party that night I might have tried to locate a different hostel.
