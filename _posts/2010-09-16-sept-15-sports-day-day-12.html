Once again, I was up at 5am for the 6am car ride. It will be the same tomorrow. I was also once again in the back of the car, but luckily there were only three of us this time. I also found out the car isn't a taxi, but one of the teachers cars. Go figure! 

I was in a different village today, the village of Yupash. Its much larger than the previous one. As it turns out, only the primary grade has laptops and it was also a regional sports day for that grade. So rather than working with the laptops and the kids, we walked about an hour to another village where about 10 schools from the area met up for track and field events along with soccer games. Apparently, the most popular sports in Peru are Soccer, Track and Field, and Volleyball. The field was literally cut out of the side of a mountain and there were probably about 200+ people there between kids, parents, and teachers. It was really great to see everyone having such a good time. I took some pictures, got stared at accordingly, and chatted with the teachers. They all seemed to be happy to have me there, although when introducing me they prefaced the conversation by telling each other I don't understand much spanish. Which is slightly ironic that I could understand that part :). Either way, they were patient with me and spoke simply and slowly. While I butchered their language in return. For some reason, after having to speak so much spanish, my head literally feels like its going to split. Trying to force my brain to work in spanish is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole!

A few of the teachers and myself didn't stay the whole time, but rather left about half-way through so that we could return to Huaraz at a reasonable time. I think they did this for me, but I couldn't understand their spanish completely :/. The ride back was quite long, but I was glad to part from my new friends because my head hurt so much from speaking spanish all day. I quickly made my way to my new favorite restaurant Cafe Yurak-Jirka for my 5sole lunch. Then I quickly made my way to a cafe I had heard about and was pleasantly surprised. The name is Cafe Andino, and it makes California Cafe look small. Its a double story place with lots of comfy places to hang out. Its got good wi-fi, which is a necessity, and a nice library. Lots of backpackers come through, so there's always a person to catch a conversation with. It's nice to have a break and speak in english for a bit. Although the highlight of the day had to be the matron telling me I spoke good spanish, which was definitely an ego booster after having the teachers tell each other I didn't understand much all day :P

For the rest of the night I plan on working on various things and relaxing. I return to Yupash tomorrow for a day of working with the kids. Hopefully the teachers won't be too disappointed with my limited spanish! Although they were super impressed once I told them I was an electrical engineer. I think that may have changed what they thought about me, because I think they thought I was just a stupid gringo here to "work with the natives" but now realize I have a purpose and just because I speak spanish like an idiot doesn't mean I am one. I think it helped that the Director of the school has a son who is studying engineering, because once his attitude changed the others followed quite easily. 

Today was interesting, even though I didn't work with they kids, it was kind of a growing day. The teachers got to understand why I am there working and we found some common ground with which to relate. Right now, I feel as if I'm in the most difficult part because my spanish is getting better but isn't good enough for proper communication. I am looking forward to getting past the hard part and being at the point where we can carry on a good conversation. And I think so are the teachers :)
