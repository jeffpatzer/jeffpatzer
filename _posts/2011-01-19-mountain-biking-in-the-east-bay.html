There are some serious hills in the San Francisco East Bay area. What this means for bikers is some great trails. After having searched for a while, I found the information regarding the two parks closest to me a bit lacking, and decided that I'd like to do a write-up to help provide some better information. The two parks I will talk about here are Joaquin Miller park and Redwood Regional. They are only separated by Skyline (the road).
<h2>Joaquin Miller</h2>
Joaquin Miller is a great little park maintained by the city of Oakland. It has a multitude of trails from single-track to the wider walking trails. It offers a great amount of variety for difficulty and fun. The best part about the park is it is right off of Highway 13 in Oakland.

A good trail: Parking can be found at multiple places around the park, however if you are looking to get right into the biking portion, I recommend Castle Dr. X Holyrood Dr. From there, take the trail going off to the left (not the one down the hill). Stay on this trail until you come to a small option to go off to the right, it will be right after the Bayview trail will go off to the left. After only a few moments you will get to the cinderella trail on your right. This is by far the best single track in the park. Go down cinderella! It is full of jumps, twists, and turns. From there you have two options for riding back up the hill - left at the bottom: circling back around on the Sunset Trail to the Sequoia Bayview Trail and ride that all the way up, veer left at the top of it; right at the bottom - Sunset Trail back to Castle Drive and up to castle drive until the road starts to bend left, there will be a super steep driveway, go up that and then on the right is Westview Trail, take that up to the top and then ride along the road for about 200ft and you'll be back at your start. There are other trails in the park that can be explored as well, but many are off-limits to bicyclists.

As always, be very friendly to pedestrians.

<h2>Redwood Regional</h2>
Redwood Regional is much larger than Joaquin Miller and boasts many more options. The only trails where bicyclists are permitted are the ones that ring the park. These are the West and East ridge trails. There are multiple signs posted that threaten severe fines for mountain bikers that veer from those paths. The overall loop is probably about 8 hours. At the south end of the loop you drop down into the valley which is a great ride, whichever side you go down, but the ride up is definitely a butt-kicker. Make sure you have enough water, because it can get pretty warm there during the day.
