Today was all about travel. Liz and I flew from Lima, Peru to Guayaquil, Ecuador. The flight was on LAN airlines, which I must say, is a great airline. Every plane has a TV in the back of every seat and the service is excellent. You can catch LAN flights all over South America for reasonable prices. I highly recommend them if you find yourself in a position to buy a ticket with their company.

When our 2 hour flight to Ecuador arrived, the biggest difference we felt was the weather. Whereas Lima is temperate, Guayaquil is hot and sticky. I quickly regretted my choice of pants. After getting through customs, which was punctuated by extremely pushy and fussy old ladies who kept trying to cut me in line, we grabbed a cab immediately to the bus terminal. Now, when I say bus terminal, I really mean terminal. As in, terminal like an airport terminal. They have lots of food stalls and large waiting rooms. There are hundreds of buses in a brand new building just waiting to whisk their passengers off to other parts of the country. The bus travel itself is on fairly comfortable busses that only cost about a dollar per hour of travel. This means you can travel just about the entirety of the country for less than 50$.

We found a bus for Riobamba, a stopping off town where we would be able to get a bus to Tena. The bus ride itself was fairly typical of the overall bus experience in South America. I sat next to an oversized lady that made it her priority to overflow and slowly commandeer more of my seat as time went on. Every time the bus stopped, food hawkers jump on trying to sell you every manner of snack food and meat sticks you can imagine. However, where this bus ride differed was the scenery. Guayaquil is extremely tropical and as you drive out of the city the landscape is peppered with banana trees. As you climb slowly higher into the mountains the banana trees disappear to simply be replaced by green. Green everywhere you look. It stretches forever. After the desert landscape of Peru, Ecuadorâ€™s green is simply mind-numbing.

Our bus arrived in Riobamba around 8pm. There are a couple terminals in the small mountain city and the busses to Tena were at a different one. We caught a cab to the Terminal Oriental (Jungle Terminal), the two bus companies were closed and there were no more busses for the night. In addition, the city block had lost all power, so it was pitch black minus the lights from candles and cars. The taxi driver recommended we go to another area to get a hotel. We quickly agreed and drove to another area that did have electricity and found ourselves a place to stay.
Having not really had a chance to eat, we went in search of food. We walked around for about 5 minutes until we found a street full of street vendors. These vendors sell food right out of a small shack, but still have tables and seats to sit on. We were able to eat a delicious meal for less than 5$, combined. Not only delicious, but economical! We topped off our meal with gelato. After food, we returned to the hotel and called it a day.
