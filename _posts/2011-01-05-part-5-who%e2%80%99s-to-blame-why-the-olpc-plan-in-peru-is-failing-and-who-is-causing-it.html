This is part 5 of a 6 part series that critically examines my experience in Peru and the situation I encountered.

<em><strong>Note</strong>: I am a graduated engineer that has been taught to think through problems and search for solutions. I am not an expert on Peru and I do not pretend to be. I am drawing on my own experiences and interpretations. My observations span twenty schools and countless interactions with the ministry and teachers over a period of approximately three months. In addition, I often refer to Hope and Josh, but I do not speak for their opinions.</em>
<h1>Who needs training? Just put the laptops out there and amazing things will happen.</h1>
After about a month and a half, we had pretty much found all the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Y31Zm3Wj1BHhFUhKxbJldKZ6KcplVQzuWnz6-zRYMbc">software problems</a> and come to grips with the hardware ones. However, one problem still remained: the issue of teacher training. Peruvian teachers break down into two groups, those trying to get accredited and accepted as full-time teachers, they work on contracts that last a couple years, and those that are accredited and pretty much set with a job for as long as they want. Those who are contracted tend to be younger and more accepting of technology. The other ones tend to be older, 45 years plus, and have almost no experience with technology.

<em>Younger Teacher</em></p>
The younger ones tend to catch on very fast and grasp the concepts quite fast. Even if they did not know where to start, once shown they caught on fast. They were also incentivized to do better, because they wanted to get hired permanently. The unfortunate part is that these teachers really only make up about 10% of the teachers I encountered. The other group, the older ones, tended to be much more difficult to teach. Disregarding their lack of experience with technology, they also simply did not have basic training in certain topics. This consisted of not knowing basic geometry, mathematics, or other topics. The technology issue was simply compounded by the inadequate education. The main idea here is that if the teachers were going to be able to use these laptops, they needed some serious training. The sad part is that there are tons of resources online, but most teachers do not know how to use the internet to access them. Most teachers do not even have email addresses, let alone the ability to search through google to find ideas on how to utilize the laptops. Internet access itself was non-existent in the villages, but they did have access to it in Huaraz. The opportunity was there, but the knowledge of how to take advantage of it was not.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="So hard by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5172682624/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5172682624_1d8fc09a66_z.jpg" alt="So hard" width="512" height="286" /></a>
<em>Thinking Hard</em></p>
Around this point, an <a href="http://edutechdebate.org/olpc-in-south-america/olpc-in-peru-one-laptop-per-child-problems/">article</a> came out describing some of the issues with the Peruvian OLPC deployment (<a href="http://edutechdebate.org/olpc-in-south-america/olpc-in-peru-one-laptop-per-child-problems/">read the article</a>). In it many issues are discussed, but beyond the issues, it is the response by Oscar Barreto that is disconcerting. He replies in the comments over 15 times, trying to discredit the article and draw attention to how the program is working. In fact, in his responses, he sadly only confirms one thing: the ministry has no idea how to make the program work. My favorite response was that if you just put the laptops out there in schools, and allow kids to play with them, then they will learn to utilize the machines and great things will happen (I cannot document this comment because it appears to have been deleted, but I guarantee it existed.).  Based on my experience, this is completely wrong. The only thing that happens is the laptops get opened, turned on, kids and teachers get frustrated by hardware and software bugs, don’t understand what to do, and promptly box them up to put back in the corner.

**Nicholas Negroponte, the head CEO of OLPC, claims the same thing in <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/people/negroponte/new_negropontism_you_can_give_kids_xo_laptops.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OneLaptopPerChildNews+%28One+Laptop+Per+Child+News%29">this article</a>**
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Can I help you? by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5172083265/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/5172083265_c679699772_z.jpg" alt="Can I help you?" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>She's not impressed</em></p>
It appears that Mr. Barreto has not used the laptops, because when he claims “Are you purposefully ignoring the laptops come loaded with hundreds of reading texts, a 30,000 entries Spanish Wikipedia and several other things that just by themselves mean a quantum leap compared to what teachers and students had available before?”, it belies a simple knowledge about the machine. The Peru image has almost no books and any books on the machine have to be accessed via the browser activity. While Wikipedia is a great resource for information, it is not a book. The “books” are simply pages of html text. Html text will never engage a child like a book does.

The ministry’s response to the article simply drew attention to one important fact: they did not want to hear criticism, even if it was constructive. They only wanted to hear that things were going great. To me, this really only said one thing: They did not care about the kids learning, but only about appearing to be doing something for the indigenous people. If people asked the administration, what are you doing to help the native people, they can say how they’ve given them laptops. They don’t have to say that they don’t train the teachers and that the laptops don’t get used by the kids.

The problem with the ministry is compounded by politics as well. Since the program was inherited from a prior administration, and when administrations change so do all the people in the agencies, nobody had a good idea of what they should be doing. This problem will repeat with the next change of administration. Rather, the current administration expanded the program without addressing the issues. More or less, they did this to garner more votes for the next election by allowing them to say they’re supporting education. Instead of doing the hard thing of providing training and follow-up, they just put laptops out in the field, and disappear. They cite geography more than anything else, as the barrier that keeps them from following up. Well, after having spent time walking between schools, I understand the issue of geography, but it is not insurmountable. In fact, a person equipped with a truck could access almost all the schools.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Teacher becomes the student by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5148333279/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5148333279_a4f3c64fe4_z.jpg" alt="Teacher becomes the student" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Teacher becomes the student</em></p>
After this series of events, one thing was for sure, the teachers were not going to get the help they needed from the ministry. The ministry was only good for lip service. They were in Lima, talking about the things that were happening, rather than in the field making it happen. As a friend of mine said, they were busy practicing <strong>“mental masturbation”. </strong>
