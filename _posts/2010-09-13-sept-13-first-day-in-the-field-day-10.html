Today was my first day of working with kids in the field in the village of San Juan de Maqui. What an experience! It really reminded me why I am here and what I am doing. I woke up at 430am (yeah, thats right mom and dad) in order to meet the teacher who I was going to be working with for the day. He met me at the hotel around 545am and we trotted over to where the car would be picking all of the teachers (and me today) up. The car we rode in was a small station wag looking sucker, and when I say we I mean 10 people. It was so packed, you wouldn't need a seat belt, you weren't going anywhere! There were three people in the front, 4 in the back seat, and then 3 in the truck area riding backwards. I was in the back, which was fine with me, but when the road is bumpy and rocky, it sure does take a toll on one's back. 

The car ride lasted about an hour following a road up out of the Huaraz valley into the mountains to the west. When we got to a certain point, the teacher and myself disembarked and started walking through the hills for another 30 minutes. The village we were heading to is literally a small grouping of houses in the hills. When we eventually arrived at the small village, we were heartily greeted by the parents and children alike. 

The teacher and me went into the school house, which was actually really nice. They have three rooms for the school, but since there aren't as many children anymore, only one gets used. They have a small garden and a dirt courtyard for recess. A couple bathrooms, and I use this term loosely because its really more like a hole in the ground, but it does the trick. 

The teacher showed me the one laptop that was broken, and I started to flash the system. At this point the kids started arriving and began to take great interest in what I was doing. I explained it to them, but I don't think they understood me. I took a picture of them and then showed them some of my other pictures. Because they were so interested in the camera, I let them play with my camera (the point and shoot), which they loved! One of the parents brought us breakfast, which consisted of these fried bread things and fresh milk. I swear it must have just come out of the udders, because it was super creamy and super sweet, and SUPER TASTY! It was just a little warm, which was perfect for fighting off the slight cold of the morning. Although, the entire I was drinking it, I was hoping I wasn't going to get some parasite and have my insides turn into a large knot. Luckily it hasn't happened yet, so I think I'm ok. 

After breakfast, the teacher began instructing the children in division and multiplication. He made great use of the calculator activity to elaborate on his points. There are only enough laptops for the 4th and 2nd graders, but I think thats okay with the 1st graders because they seemed to like the blocks more anyways. An interesting thing I noticed that the kids do is point with their middle fingers. At first I was shocked, but then realized it was just that they were pointing. At one point the kids were interested in how to say my name. Now Jeffrey is an easy enough name to say, but they don't have the Jeff word construction. Consequently, its sounds more like Heff, which for some reason they found hilarious.

After the morning lesson, I showed the 4th graders, this was while the teacher was working with the other grades, how to do multiplication by 9 using the trick that and multiple of nine under 11 adds to 9 (9*7 = 63, 6+3=9). They seemed to think it was magic, then quickly forgot it at the sound of recess. I played soccer with the boys, they seemed to like that. Yelling at me to run faster, pass it, etc...After recess we had lunch, also catered by the village. We were given a large pot of boiled potatoes and some cottage-cheese (except the curds were much finer) like lumps of cheese. You pretty much had to eat the cheese with a spoon. The kids also had this hot soup mixture of what looked like flour, provided by the Ministry. I'm glad they didn't offer it to me, because I don't think I could drink the water. 

After lunch, I showed the kids an activity on the XO called Turtle art. Essentially, its a program that allows you to program art. The teacher then asked me if I wanted to teach them the activity, of course this was meant with the large sounds of pleas and Si's. So I taught them how to make a square, which took about an hour. Partly due to their unfamiliarity with the machines, but also partly because the trackpads are extremely inaccurate. I tried cleaning the ones that weren't working, and this helped, but was still problematic. After I finished teaching them, around 1pm, the teacher and I had to leave to catch the bus back to town. However, not before we assigned them homework: multiplication/division sheet and to create a triangle with the XOs. Tomorrow I will teach them how to use eToys because it lets them create concept maps and also books. This is great because it will let them write and take pictures and paste them into the books. Then they can share the books with their friends. 

The teacher and I then departed and made the 30 minute trek back to the road. We caught a bus back to town. Now, I haven't been to China so I can't compare with that, but this had to have been the MOST CROWDED BUS I've ever seen on (and rode in). There was barely standing room, I stood the whole 1.5 hour ride back (took longer because it was a bus that had to stop). After a couple stops though, I realized there were also people sitting on top, who I had missed somehow. I swear this bus must have been carrying at least 2.5X the number of actual seats it had. Nothing like careening down a mountain road in an overpacked bus to keep you awake!

After we got back to Huaraz, I went back to my hotel and promptly took a 1.5 hour nap. Woke up, got some food, and prepared for the next day. Because tomorrow, it happens all over again :)
