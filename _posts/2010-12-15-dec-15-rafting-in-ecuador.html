<em>Jondachi-Hollin</em></p>
Today Liz and I were up earlyish and at the rafting place by 830am. The four other guys we would be sharing the day with showed up. They were a happy group made up of 3 people from LA and 1 from the Galapagos, all family. Soon after our guide and safety kayaker showed up and we were all piling in the van for the 25 minute drive to the river. The van could only drop us off close to the river though, and after that we had to walk about 30 minutes down a muddy (emphasis on muddy) track to get to the put-in point.

Once at the river, which due to rain the night before was running fast and big, we got our safety talk. After the talk we clambered into the raft and were off. The first part of the day (until lunch) was spent on mostly class III rapids, which while not large were continuous and great fun. The rain had made the level just perfect, not too fast and big, but not too slow and small. The river itself runs through a canyon for the first part of the morning. The scenery is amazing. The green-covered walls stretch up high above you, with butterflies, birds, and other animals swirling about you.

By lunchtime, everyone was starving, and we ended up eating all the food that had been brought along for lunch. This even included chocolate cake. After lunch came the class IV rapids. This meant bigger waves and faster water. It was awesome! We had the chance to ride on the front of the raft like cowboys. We were able to jump off and float through a few rapids. We stopped at some waterfalls and were able to jump off a cliff into the water. All in all, a great section of river.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and so did our day of rafting. The ride back saw most of us pass out from all the adrenaline we had had during the day. Once back in town, we said our goodbyes and headed off our separate ways. Liz and I topped our the day with a healthy-serving of street meat from the vendors.
