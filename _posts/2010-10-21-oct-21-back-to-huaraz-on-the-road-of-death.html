Today I was up with the teacher and his family, remember I am sleeping on the floor, around 530am. We prepared breakfast, washed up, and by 715am we were trudging up the hill to the school. Today I would be working with the younger group of kids, but the older class would also be joining us to help give them a chance to review more things (also their teacher had left the night before). To help the younger kids, I paired them up with older kids who could help them. We worked through a variety of things and by the end of the days the kids were exhausted but tired. During recess, I decided not to join them for hide and go seek, since my boulder incident was still fresh in my mind.

After school, we trudged back down to the teacher’s house. I was fed an extremely large lunch by the teacher and his wife, so much so that I had to take a quick nap! The teacher and his wife were packing up for the trip to Huaraz, so I mainly just watched The Little Mermaid with their daughter. We were out the door around 4 to catch the bus back to Huaraz. The bus traveled from Racrao to Pariacoto, where it stopped for about 30minutes. I used this opportunity to use the bathroom (this is important for later in the story) and walk around a bit more  Around 445pm were out of Pariacoto and on our way back to Huaraz. 

The ride back is on a precarious mountain road where they are doing construction. However, does this make the driver slow down or to take more caution, no, it does not. He plows through construction sites, past trucks, skimming all within inches. Needless to say after enough of these near-collision encounters, I was extremely glad I had already used the bathroom, or I might have crapped my pants at some point. Luckily, and surprisingly, we made it back to Huaraz alive and I made my way to the hotel. Before the teacher and I parted, he invited me to his house on Sunday for duck, the ducks we had brought back from his farm. I’m excited for some fresh Peruvian duck!
