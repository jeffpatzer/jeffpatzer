After last night's late night Karaoke I thought that I'd be able to sleep in a bit, I was wrong! I woke up promptly at 7am to the sounds of a marching band. Apparently today is a election rally day, and they wanted to get started early! In addition to the march bands, cars with massive speakers strapped to the top, streaked down the streets blaring election slogans. There were even a couple rallies in the Plaza de Armas (town square). At one point I even saw some sodas being distributed by a truck, where's my coke Obama?

Besides the early wake up call, I took the opportunity to read a bit more about the area and mark up my map of things to go and scout out. I investigated a cafe called "California Cafe" where they have a large book exchange and an even larger library of books. They have a cool vibe with some coaches and tables, whichever your preference. But, the best part, is they have WIFI! I'll definitely be hanging out here often. I then trotted down the street to check out a market where I can buy basic food supplies. They have some good deals. After this, I started to wander back to my hotel, where I found a couple courtyards in the middle of some blocks. They are very quaint and surrounded by restaurants and tour guide agencies. I also found a artisan market, where I can go to get some Peruvian goods before I head back to the states :)

After all the exploring I headed back to the hotel and Hosh and me headed out to go and get some lunch. We tried to find a vegetarian restaurant from my guide book, but it appeared to have been bulldozed, that or we just couldn't find it :/ In case anybody going to Huaraz is wondering, the place is Fuente de Salud on 562 Jose de la Mar. After lunch, we strolled around the town some more, picking up various provisions for the upcoming week. I bought some local cheese for about 1$ (what! so cheap!). I haven't tried it yet, but I'll let you all know how it tastes :)

At this point in the day, we headed back to the hotel and Josh and I went over the technical details for the XO once again. Just to refresh our memory. We made copies of the image for the XO and got everything set up that we might need. After going through all of this, we hung out working on various things. Then grabbed a small bite for dinner and topped it off with some Coca beer, which was delicious!

One thing I've noticed about the climate here is that is it quite warm, even though the altitude is quite high. It cools off at night, but not too much. The air is also quite dry, my lips are slowly becoming chapped :( but I've got some chapstick to combat it.

Did some HDR photos out of my window of the sunset :)
