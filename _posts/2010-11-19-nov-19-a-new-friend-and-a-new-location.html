Last night we traveled from Huaraz to Trujillo via bus overnight. We arrive in Trujillo very early in the morning. To give a new type of accommodation a try, we decided to try our luck out with a site known as <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/">CouchSurfing</a>. We met our host at the bus station and took a cab back to his place. He put us up on the room on the top of his house (literally its on the roof), which is actually awesome. We can see the entire city and we get to share the space with a Peruvian Hairless dog. The dog is a special breed specific to Peru and has to be one of the most ugly animals I've ever seen. His skin is very oily and soft, but you can't pet it because its very sensitive. He's quite friendly, but so ugly. You can't help but feel bad for him.

After dropping off our things, our host walked us around the city center, which he lives close to. We stopped at a park for a bit to toss a Frisbee around for a break at one point. After seeing most of the beautiful architecture that makes up Trujillo, we decided to go out to the close-by beach, Huanchaco. The beach is a big destination for surfers and water enthusiasts. We took the 30 minute and 0.40$ bus out to the beach. We walked around the small town and got some ceviche and deep-fried fish for lunch. Being able to sit and enjoy the sun, wind, and smell of the ocean was a great change of pace from the Sierra that we had been living in for so long.

After the beach, we went back to town and meandered off to find an internet cafe. We only had a short period of time before we had to meet up with some of our host's friends. We did some quick emails and before we knew it were in a taxi off to spend the night with some friends of his. We spent the rest of the night chatting and eventually made it to a salsa club where Hope finally fulfilled her desire of Salsa dancing. We were able to finally tuck in around 3am after a long and tourist filled day :)
