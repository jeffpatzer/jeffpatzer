Today was our jungle tour. Liz and I were at the office at 7am, but had to wait until 720am for the people to actually show up (even though they had said 7). After getting our rubber boots, we shuffled into a guy’s truck and began the 30 minute drive out to their reserve. We were dropped off at some buildings close off the road where we were given tea, while the guy chauffeuring us had breakfast. Up until this point, we thought this guy, Fausto was our guide. So when we began walking back into the forest on a paved concrete walkway, and he wasn’t saying anything or explaining anything, we began to get a bit suspicious.

After about 20 minutes we arrived at a cabana where we were introduced to our real guide. It turns out Fausto was merely dropping us off. We took in the sight of the forest and waited while the two guys got things in order. Fausto then explained that we would do a 3 hour walk with our guide, then we would eat lunch, rest a bit, and return to the road where we could catch a bus back to Tena. He informed us that we would have to pay for the bus, which was only 50 cents. At this point, I told Fausto that he was mistaken. The tour was all-inclusive, especially transportation. The fact he wanted to put us on a bus already pissed me off, but that he wanted us to pay was unacceptable. He said that he had paid for the truck to come out there. I told him that didn’t matter, he was supposed to do that and that he would also pay for the bus back to town. By now Fausto, had in my mind, become a weasel. So of course he tried to play his comment off by saying that we had talked with the girl in the office and he couldn’t know what she said, but that he would honor what she had promised. I told him good, glad he understood that.

After Fausto’s little theatrics we started our jungle tour. The path led off into the shrubbery where we were soon engulfed by heat, humidy, green, trees, and insects. Our guide explained the different use of the plants, different types of trees, the medicinal plants, the most common insects, pointed out large spiders and some birds, and topped things off by letting us climb up a 60 meter tree to see the jungle from above the canopy. The rickety rebar ladder was not that comforting, but the view was spectacular. As far as the eye could see, trees and green pervaded the vision. After the tree, we returned to the cabana for lunch.

After lunch we walked back along the concrete path to road and caught the bus back to Tena. The bus was a local bus, hence packed with people and bad music. It brought back memories of the busses in Peru for me. Once back in town, we returned to the hostal to shower off. The jungle had been brutally humid, and as such, had meant we had sweated almost non-stop.
While the jungle tour had been interesting, it had also been a bit disappointing. This had nothing to do with the plants and insects we saw, but more to do with the company. Like most things, what they had said and what they had done, had been two different things. Fausto had been disingenuous and lied, and only when I confronted him and told him to his face what he would do, did he do it. For this reason, I do not recommend their company, MundoPuma. They were unprofessional and untrustworthy, and for this reason I recommend searching for another company.
