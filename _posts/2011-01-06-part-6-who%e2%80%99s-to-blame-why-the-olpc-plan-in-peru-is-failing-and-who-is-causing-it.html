This is part 6 of a 6 part series that critically examines my experience in Peru and the situation I encountered.

<em><strong>Note</strong>: I am a graduated engineer that has been taught to think through problems and search for solutions. I am not an expert on Peru and I do not pretend to be. I am drawing on my own experiences and interpretations. My observations span twenty schools and countless interactions with the ministry and teachers over a period of approximately three months. In addition, I often refer to Hope and Josh, but I do not speak for their opinions.</em>
<h1>So, what is the problem and how can we fix it?</h1>
After all this I hope that it has become clear, that there isn’t just one problem, but a series of problems. OLPC built a laptop that doesn’t work well and has many problems. The Peruvian ministry of education has software that is too buggy and an infrastructure not built to support the deployment. Teachers do not have the training and sadly, the ability to change their situation.

So how do you make the deployment work with what is already there?
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Dios Mio! by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5125400163/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1309/5125400163_effe485924_z.jpg" alt="Dios Mio!" width="340" height="512" /></a>
<em>Dios Mio!</em></p>
<strong>First,</strong> fix the software and hardware bugs. The good news is that this is being undertaken by a couple of people in the ministry. The bad news is that even with this update, it will still be years behind the current Sugar release available from the Sugar labs. Deployment and update on the old machines will also be extremely hard, despite the ministry’s assertion that it will be done by next march (they themselves say geography is an issue). Hardware-wise any schools that get new laptops will have machines that have much better functioning mouse pads, but any schools with the original machines, will still suffer from the hardware problems.

<strong>Second</strong>, train the teachers and follow-up. Many of the teachers could grasp the concepts and how to use the machines, if only provided with the right training. This means, one-on-one training in their school where they are comfortable and relaxed. Calling all the teachers to Huaraz for a big workshop for one day, accomplishes almost nothing. The teachers do not learn well in groups, but need help one-by-one. We saw both systems tried, and without a doubt workshops do not work, but one-on-one instruction does. Equally important is follow-up. Going back to the teachers, asking them about the problems they’re having, and working towards solutions. The teachers are the people working with the laptops day-in and day-out, they know what needs to change and be fixed.

<strong>Third,</strong> stop making excuses and do the hard work. People sitting in Lima talking about the problems that stand in the way, like geography, will not help anybody. Building a system that can train and support the deployment takes people in the field, and that is where the ministry should be deploying resources. The sad thing is that while that will help the children, it won’t change the politic picture. Putting people out in the country-side, won’t get more votes, so it won’t happen.
So who is to blame through all this?
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Yes? by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5182552967/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1282/5182552967_fdc9533cb4_z.jpg" alt="Yes?" width="512" height="340" /></a>
<em>Why don't you tell me?</em></p>
The truth is that almost everybody is to blame. Everybody has messed up on some level. OLPC, the ministry, the interns, everyone has in some way made mistakes that have created a deployment that doesn’t accomplish its fundamental goal, helping kids change their lives for the better. Does this mean that there aren’t success stories? No, there are success stories, but they are few and the reality is not the success stories. And it is irresponsible and naïve to tout a few stories as proof that the program is working.

After this whole article, I don’t want you to think that I am only complaining. What I am trying to do is bring attention to the issues and problems that face the program, to realistically open the eyes of the public to what the situation is like on the ground. I hope that after this, the program can be approached more realistically. Honestly, what I really want is to see the kids have the ability to change their situations using machines like the laptops. I think most people do. But, acknowledging the reality of the situation and then figuring out how to make things works is much better than just making excuses and not really fixing the problem.

A person doing a phD has a similar <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/peru/reflections_on_4_months_of_observing_una_laptop_por_nino.html">article</a> on their experience.
