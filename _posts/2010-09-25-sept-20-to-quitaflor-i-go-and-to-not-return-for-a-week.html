Wow, so this was the earliest that I had to wake up in all my time in Peru. I was up at 2:45am for the 4am bus ride into the Cordillera Negra. I was lucky in that there were available seats on the bus so that I could sit with my large 70L backpack on my lap. I pretty much slept the entire way because it was so frickin early! A quick side note on the geography of Peru. There is a Cordillera Blanca and Negra. The Blanca is the one that you see pretty pictures of, it is covered in snow, a huge trekking destination, and a big outdoor adventure area. The Negra is a more arid area that gets little rain and seems to be covered in a layer of dust (including the people that live there) at all times. You can’t escape it, the dust will find you. My best analogy is to imagine mountains with no vegetation except where there are farms. Huaraz is the town that sits in between them, hence its position as a great launching point.

Upon my arrival to Quitaflor, the school where I’d be spending the day and night, we were treated to a breakfast of potatoes, rice, and instant coffee, with a side of rabbit and guinea pig. Everything is cooked in a mud/metal stove using wood as the fuel. The “kitchen” area was a mud-walled and mud-floored shack with rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, and a cat cohabitating in the space. However, my insides have yet to melt, so I think everything was good.

After breakfast, we headed down into the school, which was down the ‘slope’ about 500 yards. Going down was easier than coming back up in the afternoon.  Before the start of school, all the pupils were lined up an arms lengths apart (arms were used to measure :P ) and given the Ten-Hut command, then the at ease release. The director of the school gave me a brief introduction and then asked me to say a few words in front of the students. So in front of about 50 students I began to bumble my way through the speech.  It went along the lines: “Hi, my name is Jeffrey…uh…I’m here to help you with your laptops…um…um…If any of them are broken or have problems let me know…uh…I’m happy to be here…um…I hope we can learn some new stuff today…um…and so on.” Then one of the kids asked if I spoke English, I said yes I did, so then he asked if I could speak it to them. I raddled off a few sentences to keep them happy. It seemed to do the trick, because they started laughing. At this point, out of things to say, I wandered over to the director, where he seemed to understand I was finished. To recognize my effort the children serenaded me with a song in Quecha (the local tongue). After this the students disbanded and made their way into their various class rooms.

I followed the 1-2nd grade class where I would be working for the first part of the day, until after recess where I would switch over to the older group of 3-5th graders. I spent the majority of the morning fixing laptops, and the majority of the after recess session doing the same. However, I got to take a break at recess to join the kids for a game of soccer. They actually have a nice little court to play on. Since I was only going to be at the school for a day, the teachers asked if we could do an afternoon session to teach the children a new activity. I heartily agreed and we parted for lunch. In the afternoon the students returned to do a joint workshop. While we were waiting to get things started, I taught them English words by point at things on my body. They were extremely interested in knowing more English, although had some difficulty pronouncing a lot of the words. This is mostly because in English there are different sounds that just don’t exist in Spanish. After the English lesson, we got started with the workshop. I worked on teaching them how to create books in eToys. The kids were extremely hard workers and we plowed ahead for about two hours, until it was just before it was dark.
After the workshop, we parted ways and I went to stay with the director. He gave me his room at the family’s house. The room (see attached photos), consisted of a mud floor, mud walls, mud roof, and plywood door that was locked using a stick propped against the ground. The roof has plastic sheeting nailed into it to keep mud from falling on the person. This was only partly affected as I was awoken in the middle of the night with mud dropping onto my face. I tried to find the bathroom before going to sleep, no luck, so I just peed in the bushes.

Overall it was an exciting day, although unknown to me at the time, the first of many for the week.

Still to be added: Video of kids singing for me.
