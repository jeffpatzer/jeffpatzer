Tonight I will fly out from Lima and be back in LA around 9am (with a routing through Dallas). I've been in South America since September 3rd. I've explored the Cordillera Negra, mostly by foot. I've enhanced by spanish ability past bumbling idiot to stumbling oaf. I've gotten stomach sickness, altitude sickness, and sometimes just felt crummy. I've taken night buses where I froze and day buses where I roasted. I've lost a water bottle, headlamp, jacket, sandals, and almost lost my hat. I've eaten guinea pig (not that bad) and had more than my fair share of rice and potatoes. I've been a volunteer and a tourist, but always a gringo. It's been a life-changing experience for me. I will NOT be the same after this. But the <strong>only thing I want for christmas,</strong> is to be home.
