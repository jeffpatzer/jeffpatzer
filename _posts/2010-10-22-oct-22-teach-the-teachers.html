When I arrived at the hotel last night, Hope and Josh informed me that we were to be teaching a workshop for teachers today (Friday). Therefore, instead of sleeping in, I was up at 6am and ready for our 8am departure. The specialist Capistrano picked us up and we walked to where the workshop was going to be held, in a school nearby. 

Before things got going, the Specialist was showing some students features of the laptops

Many of the teachers who I had already worked with were present, as well as new ones. It was good to get to see everyone again. Capistrano started things off explaining all the things the Hosh and I had done. He went into intricate details about how there was no place I couldn’t go, that I would reach anywhere, without fault, the only thing I was missing was a lady friend, and that I go “WHERE THE DEVIL WON’T”. After such an introduction, how could I follow that with a workshop?! 

There were about 35 teachers in this one room. Hosh and myself, launched into a variety of workshops, going over many activities and answering a plethora of questions. It was like herding cats, trying to start activities, explain, help, and do any other thing that was asked of us. By the end of the workshop, we were all exhausted and very hungry. When things wrapped up at 1, we trudged off for lunch. After lunch we had a nice break, relaxing in the hotel. I eventually had to go out to buy a bus ticket for Sunday’s travels. Josh and I also arranged to go for a bike ride the following day (Saturday). We both knocked out early, in preparation for our 7am departure the next day.
