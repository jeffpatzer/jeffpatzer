Monday for me, technically started Sunday night. I was one a bus around 8pm for the 3 hour ride to Pariacoto. While most people on the bus were sleeping, I would not be that lucky. I was stuck next to this obnoxious lady that would not shut up! Everytime I was able to pass out, she started yapping again. Sigh, no sleep for me. We arrived in Pariacoto around 11 and I went to the Directora’s house, this is also the radio station I talked about last week.  I slept on their couch until about 430am in the morning, when we had to get up so that we could take a cab to the school. The cab ride itself was 2 hours up into the hills, with me bobbing in and out of consciousness due to the small amount of sleep.

We finally got to the end of the road, they’re extending it now, where we all bailed out. From there it was another 45min walk to the actual town. At about 7am in the morning, this definitely woke me up and got my blood pumping. We got to the school, and I had breakfast with the Directora. On the walk over they had told me that there was no electricity in the school (or whole little town for that matter). Additionally, they also have three classes and about 32 students. Needless to say, these are a few problems for one person to have to deal with. However, did I panic? No, I went about solving the problems in a systematic engineering manner. The teacher asked if I wanted to work with all kids at once. I politely declined (you know what herding cats is like, right?) and decided to work with one class at a time for half a day each. This ended up working fairly well, and on the second day I worked with everyone at once, using what battery life we had left to work in groups of five or six.

Now, I am about to begin a rant about not having electricity, I apologize in advance.
<strong>Problem 1</strong>: The town of Pallac has electric lines installed, however, they don’t work.  The state screwed that one up.
<strong>Problem 2</strong>: There is no alternative charging system. No solar panels, no generator, no hand crank, no bike crank, nothing.
<strong>Problem 3</strong>: The closest town with electricity is a 5 hour round trip walk.
<strong>Problem 4</strong>: The teachers didn’t know that they could take the batteries, because they are all the same, and charge them in one or two laptops back at their homes in the cities. This meant, that the laptops were not getting charged, unless kids went to the closest town to charge their laptops.
<strong>Problem 5</strong>: Only being able to charge a laptop once a week, means the kids only use it once a week, meaning they never have the chance to play with and explore the system.
So, a culmination of issues has created a situation where kids want to learn, but can’t. Who, for the love of god, didn’t research this before distributing the laptops. Seriously, the hardest part of getting the kids the laptops is done. It’s absolutely ridiculous.

Update - I wrote the Ministry of Education about this, I got a one line response - "We'll look for a solution" translation "Blah, Blah, Blah we won't do anything". Sorry if I sound bitter, but this pisses me off.
