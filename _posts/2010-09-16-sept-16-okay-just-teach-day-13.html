Once again, I was up early at 5am for the 6am, 1.5hr ride in the trunk area to the village of Yupash. Today was a bit different because I had to teach two different classes, did I mention I'm supposed to be a Technical Intern, throughout the day. Literally from the start of class at about 8am in the morning to the 1pm end of the day I was teaching. Oh, did I already mention that I'm a technical intern? 

I taught the primary grade and then the younger version of the primary grade. I think the difference was between kindergarden and 1st grade, but I'm only guessing here. I worked with the older kids first. Literally the opening of class was as follows:

Teacher - "Good morning class. Today we have a special guest who is very knowledgable with the XO laptops. Give him a round of applause (I thank them). He is going to work with us today to learn some new things. Ok, go ahead and teach Jeff"
Jeff's Internal Brain Response - "Uh, what?!"

But I took to it like a duck to water. Although the kids were a bit quiet, I got them to open up a bit by making jokes in my terrible spanish. I asked them if anyone had any broken laptops, they didn't. So we went immediately into creating concept maps and books, like I did with the previous school. There were about 17 students though, instead of 5, so it was a bit more difficult to wrangle them. But somehow we got through both things. There were a couple students who got things much quicker, so I used them to help teach the others. I am thankful they were so open to doing so. For some reason, this group of students found making the books easier than the concept maps, the opposite of the previous school. Interesting huh? Anyways, around 11 we broke for recess/lunch. I got some food at the local restaurant (I use this term loosely). Then back to work with the younger group.

Now, when I walked in I could immediately feel a difference in energy. These kids were extremely upbeat and bubbly. They greeted me heartily and the teacher introduced me as follows:

Teacher - "Okay class, today we have a special guest, Jeffrey. Applause (I thank them). He  knows a lot about the XO's (they giggle in delight). Okay, Jeffrey, just go ahead and teach them about an activity."
Jeff''s Internal Response - "WTF? Again?" 
Jeff''s Verbal Response - "Uh do you have a preference?"
Teacher - "No"
Jeff's Internale Response - "Good thing I can improvise?"

Now I had been told the younger kids would be slower and not know as much, I soon found out how wrong this was. We started with some basic activities, which soon showed me that they were actually much more capable then their older counter parts. In fact they were so fast, they were discovering parts the programs faster than I could show them. I soon realized doing the maze activity was just not hard enough, they need more of a challenge. So then we worked on taking a picture and pasting it into Write, which took them about 5 minutes. Seriously, they mastered the clipboard concept that fast, wow! Okay, so that wasn't difficult enough. I immediately switched to the Turtle Art program, which was definitely a better speed. But, once again I was surprised that they found the examples (the program has about 15) in about 30 seconds. So I had to wrangle their attention back in, they were super enamored with all the different examples. We started work on created a rectangle, which they took to quite well. We were able to accomplish it relatively quickly (much faster than the first school). However, what impressed me the most were the girls in the class. They couldn't have been older than six, but they were absolute wizzes with the program. Creating the rectangle easily, mastering the program, and understanding nuances that I hadn't even mentioned. The boys were also extremely quick, but the girls were constantly running over to me saying "Were done, what next" Honestly, they were so good I was just about speechless. 

After the rectangle we made a circle, and while I couldn't describe the idea of angles and radius, because they were too young. This too they were able to do quite easily. The kids were so into it, that when the bell rang they didn't even notice. In fact, it was the other teacher telling us it was time to go. I really felt at the end of the session that these kids were going to be able to play with turtle art and master it on their own. A couple of the girls wanted to take their XOs home with them. I realized right then what I was seeing, these were girls that were mastering concepts and systems that would have been so far removed from them had they not gotten these laptops. They were building skills that will surely open doors for them in the future. I know it sounds sappy, but that's the truth. Their love of the system and excitement to use it, is the stuff that will drive them to succeed and excel in life in ways that would not have been available before. 

After the class, we piled back into the car (me in the back) for the drive back. In the car I couldn't help but think about the differences between the two classes and the teachers in control of the classes. The older group had a more reserved teacher who was quieter. The kids too were more reserved. The younger group had a teacher that never stops smiling and is a firecracker. The kids were similar in their interaction. It really made me think about how much influence one exerts around kids just by who you are. And while I'm not saying one is better than another, I am saying that what type of teacher you have can make a big difference in your development of interests and work ethic. 

Okay, so this has been a long post, but it was stuff on my mind all day. I'm really happy these schools are so open to me and excited to learn. Thanks to the school in Yupash and San Juan de Maqui, I hope that I've made at least some small helpful difference in your lives. I only hope that the great experiences keep coming and I'm up to the task. 

Upon my return to Huaraz I went back to my hotel, switched out the stuff in my back pack, and trotted off to Cafe Andino (the nice one I found yesterday). Won't do too much for the rest of the night except work. Tomorrow I'll be going to a school closer to Huaraz and don't have to leave until 9am, so maybe I'll wake up at 6am instead :P
