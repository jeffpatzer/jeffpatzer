Today I was up very early, 245am to be exact. I was ready with my things by 315am and had woken up the kid who would be walking with me to the road by 330am (he was my guide because it was dark and I only knew the general direction I was to be going). The reason I was up this early was because I need to hike to the road in order to catch the 530am combi that would take me back to Huaraz. The walk was for the most part in the “level”, which means there was no hiking up a hill. The poor kid walking with me was 12 years old and was definitely lagging at points. I gave him some energy bars and his pace picked up immediately. It also didn’t help that it wasn’t particularly warm. Either way we got to the road after about 1.75 hours and the combi came soon after. I gave the kid the rest of the food that I had so he could eat something before having to walk back.

The ride back in the combi took about 3 hours. I would have tried sleeping, but the driver was a maniac. Literally, a maniac. Now, but this point, I’ve gotten used to people driving fast on dirt mountain roads, but this guy was something else. Curve coming up? No worries, speed into it! Car to pass? No worries, drive faster and swerve while clenching your knuckles. It’s a wonder I didn’t crap myself at certain points. It probably helped that I was tired and half out of it :/. Either way, we did get back to Huaraz and I made a beeline for a café to eat breakfast. I ended up staying at the café for most of the day catching up on internet. I eventually meandered over to the hotel, took a shower, and went to sleep in a bed not made of sheep skins, which while not as warm did smell a bit better!
