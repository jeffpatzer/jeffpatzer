Many of the villages that I have been visiting live with the most basic of needs. The rarely have running water in the small aqueduct systems. They eat potatoes and rice for every meal, usually accompanied by soup and cafesito (boiled black water with sugar). They eat off the floor or their laps. They rarely shower or bathe. Washing one’s hand is rare and fingernails are always dirty. Dust permeates everything and the smell of farm animals clings to the people. The houses are made of adobe bricks with perhaps one light bulb in a building. Due to these harsh and most basic of conditions, medical care is basic and extremely limited.

When one is sick, your remedy is often eucalyptus tree-leaf tea or any other combination of herb water. While these sometimes help with the occasional stomach ache, they do not help with other diseases or ailments. Many of the kids suffer from serious bouts of warts. The warts cover the hands, often numbering upwards of 15 on a single hand, and with sizes sometimes approaching a dime. There are no cures for this. They cannot burn them off with super-cold liquid nitrogen. They cannot sear them off with a heat gun. All they can do is permit the warts to grow and spread without check.

Besides warts, the other most prominent ailment is frostbite on the kid’s hands and faces. This will create hands covered in scabs and checks that are affected the same way. This give the kids rosy cheeks, while in reality they are really just scabs. Combine this with dirt and you have some very unhealthy looking skin.

The last thing that affects the kids is diarrhea. They drink the water from the tap and the streams, which are contaminated with animal feces. This results in making the kids sick to the stomach. While they confess to being used to the water, this is only partly true.  It is never possible to be completely used to contaminated water.

These three things are only a few of the many medical issues that plague the communities. While they are a big problem, sometimes I have to wonder if teaching kids to use laptops might not be the most pressing matter when they suffer from other physical ailments.
