I ran into an old friend yesterday and as all post-college kids are prone to do, we started talking about what we are "doing with our lives". The sentence is probably the most feared and difficult one to answer. While I personally don't ever think that it is fully answered, you can at least figure out parts. Anyways, I digress.

While I was in Peru with <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/one-laptop-per-child/">OLPC</a> I got to meet a lot of travelers and learn about a lot of resources available. It really made me appreciate how much travel can make you grow and learn as a person. All the new experiences and interactions are on the whole positive and useful. Well, I got to talking with this friend and started to describe the traveling experience, and really saw him get excited. See, he is currently living at home with his parents, and while not a bad situation, definitely one he wants to change. When he said I just want to move out and have a little money saved, I recommend that he take that money and buy a plane ticket, and go. It was one of those statements where you see someone just totally absorb an idea and really consider it on the spot. One of the "I never thought of that, but it sounds really doable." It was awesome.

Since I gathered together such a nice list of resources while in Peru, I told him I would them to him. But as I was writing the email, I thought, this would make an awesome blog post. So compiled below is a list of websites, blog posts, and other resources that can really be used to find cheap places to go, cheap plane tickets, cheap places to stay, and all other sorts of goodies.

*** My last bit of advice is this: free advice is good, advice you pay for is better. Some of the sites might provide services that are minimal, but the potential advice that one can garner is going to be about 50X better than the free stuff they show. Just keep that in mind when deciding to pay.

** None of these sites asked me to do this. They are what I personally find useful. Keep that in mind.
<h3><strong>Nomadic Matt's Travel Site</strong></h3>
<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/">http://www.nomadicmatt.com/</a>

--&gt; Probably the best one for information. A must read. He has lots of links to other peoples site that might have more place specific information for you. (My friend Hope hates his writing style, but his content is great, so can't argue with that :P)
<h3><strong>The Art of Non-conformity</strong></h3>
<a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/">http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/</a>

--&gt; A must read for anyone. Even if you aren't doing travel. His books and posts are absolutely inspiring. Want to break out of the mundane and do something with your life? Tangibly? This is your man to help show you how.

**** His travel site <a href="http://travelhacking.org/">http://travelhacking.org/</a> could literally save you hundreds of dollars with ideas on how to get cheap tickets and travel on the cheap. Well worth the price to pay to get his advice if you're new to the travel game.

<h3><strong>TravelZoo</strong></h3>

I would recommend that once you know where you want to go, go to the store, read some of the guide books on the places, see which ones you like, and purchase one of them. No more than one, remember you'll have to carry that weight :)
