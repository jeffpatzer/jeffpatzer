This is part 3 of a 6 part series that critically examines my experience in Peru and the situation I encountered.

<em><strong>Note</strong>: I am a graduated engineer that has been taught to think through problems and search for solutions. I am not an expert on Peru and I do not pretend to be. I am drawing on my own experiences and interpretations. My observations span twenty schools and countless interactions with the ministry and teachers over a period of approximately three months. In addition, I often refer to Hope and Josh, but I do not speak for their opinions.</em>

Our bus trip to Huaraz, which was long and somewhat uneventful, can be revisited at <a href="http://jeffpatzer.com/2010/09/09/day-6-nine-hours-in-a-bus-from-lima-to-huaraz/">this post</a>.  The next day we met with the Ancash laptop specialist, who would be directing us where to go for our time in Huaraz. He informed Hope and Josh they would be spending two weeks at a time in one school, while I would be traveling to many schools and working for two days at time. At this point he handed us handwritten maps with approximate walking times and travel times between schools. The numbers at first were staggering and as I would come to find out, the reality, even more so.

As I began to visit schools, I slowly became more familiar with the laptop and its limitations. Most of the workshops the Ministry had suggested I discarded because they were cumbersome and unrealistic. The reality of most schools was they only had a basic knowledge of how to operate the laptops. Additionally, the mouse pads, besides having a terrible design, often became so dirty that they stopped functioning. The most disturbing fact we discovered though was the software image being used was over two years old. While this doesn’t necessarily have to be a cause of problems, it is when the software never gets updated and bugs never get fixed.

<em>Concentration</em></p>
Peru had designed its own software image of Sugar, the XO operating system. A good way to think of Sugar and the image would be like a horse and donkey. They are somewhat similar but still different enough that they are separate animals. When Peru created their own software image they essentially cut themselves off from all the assistance provided to updating Sugar out of Sugar Labs. What this really means is the continual bug updates and other fixes being pushed to the normal Sugar image from the labs (think window’s updates or mac software updates), would never reach the Peru image, until the updates had been customized for the Peru image. This creates a huge time-lag and bottleneck.

A majority of the programs have some serious issues that have not been fixed since their initial deployment. No follow-up is performed to solve problems. What is worse, is that many students and teachers cannot understand when problems occur and why they are occurring. They only understand that something is not working and get extremely frustrated. This usually causes them to abandon using the programs and also lose confidence in the laptop. To give one an idea of the severity of the issues, it took Hope, Josh, and me the course of a few months to discover a variety of errors and minor solutions to get the programs to function as intended.
