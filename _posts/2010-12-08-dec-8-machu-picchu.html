<em>To Machu Picchu</em></p>
Today is the day, the day that Liz and I would see the most famous place in South America, Machu Picchu (MP).
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254427102/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5287/5254427102_525a9a4298_z.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Machu Picchu</em></p>
As with anything that is extremely famous and well-known, we had to be up early. Liz and I were up at 345am and out the door by 445am. We walked the block or so to the bus station where we grabbed a place in line. We were not too far back, which was good to know. As we waited for the 520am hour to strike, we listened to music and stared at the wall. Eventually the time came and people began filing onto busses. While shuffling forward we heard the words yelled out “Have your bus ticket in your hand,” to which I thought, “WHAT?!” I had been under the impression, based on my myriad of experiences with Peruvian transportation, that once on the bus we would pay the fare. I was very wrong.  After talking to one of the guards, he informed me we had to buy the tickets at the booth. Well, I ran to the booth, where I had to wait in-line for about 10 minutes to buy the tickets. By the time I finally got the tickets, we were the last two people on the last set of early morning busses. Good luck or bad luck? I’m not really sure, but I did feel like a dumbass (which was not helped by Liz snickering).

Once on the bus, the 15min ride was easy and quick.  When we arrived at Machu Picchu, we got into the queue to wait for admittance into the famous site.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Clouds by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253827761/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5208/5253827761_854956fd73_z.jpg" alt="Clouds" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Morning Clouds</em></p>
We got our tickets stamped so that we could climb Huanya Pichu (HP), the mountain peak behind Machu Picchu (it’s in all the photos pretty much). Once at the entrance we had to show passports and our student IDs, which is the most rigorous ID check I’ve had in Peru.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Ruin Walking by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253833631/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5253833631_f44fe909ec_z.jpg" alt="Ruin Walking" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Ruin Walking</em></p>
Once inside the gates, we made our way quickly to the back of the site, where the gates to HP are located. We were the first few out of the gate and the first at the top.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Huana Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254441024/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5206/5254441024_1b3ef6b42a_z.jpg" alt="Huana Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Huanya Picchu</em></p>
The climb is almost vertical although quite short. What takes most people about 45mins, took Liz and I only 20. Why you might ask? Because we’re awesome! Why else?
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Afraid of Heights? by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253820711/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5047/5253820711_b4bd143cef_z.jpg" alt="Afraid of Heights?" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Afraid of Heights?</em></p>
Once at the top of the peak, the view is truly amazing. One can take in all of MP and the surrounding valleys and mountains.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254429986/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5209/5254429986_1d479ae8b5_z.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width="480" height="640" /></a>
<em>Machu Picchu and Me</em></p>
There are clouds whipping up the face of the mountain, giving the site a mystic feel. The river rumbles far below the sheer cliffs that surround the site. Liz and I had timed it right, as we arrived at the top right as the sun crested the hills and shown down through the clouds onto MP. Not only did it give me great light for photos :P, but it also was amazingly beautiful. Since Liz and I were some of the first up, we had a good deal of time to simply take in the sight without interruption. Truly, a once in a lifetime experience.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254427102/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5287/5254427102_525a9a4298_z.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Machu Picchu</em></p>
After HP, we made our way slowly back down the vertical, wet, slippery stairs and up the small mini peak over MP. While there was nobody on this small peak (most opt for the bigger one), it did provide another great view of the site.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Inca Cola &amp; Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253814553/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5085/5253814553_f11a1e14fe_z.jpg" alt="Inca Cola &amp; Machu Picchu" width="425" height="640" /></a>
<em>Inca Cola &amp; Machu Picchu</em></p>
Eventually Liz and I were back in the site itself, where we could wander among the buildings. The buildings, architecture, layout, stonework, and almost every other facet (including the tourist density) is unlike anywhere else in Peru.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5253831985/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5243/5253831985_47507de41d_z.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Mach Picchu</em></p>
While MP is somewhat like a tourist trap, it is also a one-of-a-kind place that cannot be understood until visited. Until you look out from the main plaza, or temple of three windows, into the vast mountains surrounding the area, you cannot understand the power of the place.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Liz at Machu Picchu by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254417830/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5247/5254417830_3ea03dc14e_z.jpg" alt="Liz at Machu Picchu" width="640" height="425" /></a>

Plus, why give up climbing hundreds of stairs over the course of the day while looking at the ruins? Although, you do begin to feel bad for the elderly visiting the site, I mean, climbing rock stairs at high altitude is hard for anybody.

After spending about 7 hours wandering through the site, playing with Llamas, and taking hundreds of photos, we left the site and began the hike back down the hill.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Admiring the view by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254421800/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5254421800_0f2ba6576e_z.jpg" alt="Admiring the view" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Admiring the view</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Llama beak by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5254419806/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5254419806_5652dc70a1_z.jpg" alt="Llama beak" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>Llama beak</em></p>
The hike down the hill is mostly steps and took us about 35 minutes. The whole time it drizzled, up until we reached the bottom, when the sun came out. Typical. We grabbed lunch since we were starving and headed to a café to hang out until we could leave by train. When we grabbed dinner, it actually induced some serious stomach pain for Liz, so we rested at the train station for a couple of hours until the train took off. Once back in Ollantaytambo, we got a colectivo back to Cusco. By the time we were back in Cusco (2am) we were exhausted and made a bee-line for the hostel. Once there we didn’t even bother to shower, but just plopped down in bed and passed out. Despite the stomach pain and late arrival, it was an amazing day.
