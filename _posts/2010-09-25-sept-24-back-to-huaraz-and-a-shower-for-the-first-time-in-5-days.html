Today I woke up feeling great. Because I had been able to use the bathroom yesterday, my appetite had returned. The cold affecting me seemed to have disappeared as well. But, and this really was the thing lifting my spirits the most, I would be returning to Huaraz for a hot shower and some different food. Because I was up early enough, I took a bunch of landscape pictures. I then washed my face and got ready for the school day. 

We worked with the kids by taking pictures of the outside and then annotating them. The kids seemed to enjoy it quite a bit and the day seemed to fly by. The teacher and myself had to leave around 12 to make it back to the other side of the valley and catch the bus back to town. It was a hard walk, mostly because once we got to the road, there were no cars. This meant we had to start walking towards the main town. Luckily a construction worker came by and was able to take the teacher (she is a mid-40s lady). This was good because it was hot and the walking was difficult. I walked for the extra hour to the town and then had to wait for another 30 minutes to catch a car back to Huaraz. 

Once back in Huaraz, I met up with Hosh and we all took showers. I used a whole bar of soap. Then we decided to go and splurge on a nice dinner to celebrate our return back to hot water. It was a nice dinner where we shared our stories. Hosh had been out for two weeks in one place, so no walking, but also no water for showering. We were all happy to be back in Huaraz and took a long time to eat. We then returned back to the hotel to crawl into nice, sheeted beds. 
And needless to say, that was the end of a very long and interesting week.
