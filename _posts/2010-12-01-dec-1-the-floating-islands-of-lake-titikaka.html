Liz and I arrived on a night bus from Arequipa in Puno at about 5am in the morning. Puno is the small Peruvian town that squats between the edge of Lake Titikaka and surrounding mountains. It’s quite high at around 3800m. Lake Titikaka (LT) is the highest and largest navigable lake in the world. While there are lakes that are bigger in size, none are bigger at this altitude.

<em>Lake Titikaka</em></p>
After gathering our bags, Liz and I proceeded into the bus terminal. The bus terminals are much like airport terminals, except that they are full of people that attack any tourist as soon as they step into the building. We were quickly pestered with questions about tours, hostals, hotels, taxis, and any other variety of services. We already had a hostal, so we flagged down a taxi and took off. When we arrived at the hostal we were able to arrange a tour of the floating islands and a larger island in the main part of the lake. We also arranged our bus for the next day to go to Cusco. All this was done before 6am in the morning.

After dropping our bags in our room, we got picked up for our tour at 645am. The van drove us to the docks we boarded a boat with about 15 other people. After a few minutes the boat shoved off and we were on our way to the Uros floating islands. The islands are man-made out of reeds. Since they are reeds, they have to continually be building the islands to keep them afloat. There are approximately 60 islands, each with its own person in charge. The islands originally came into existence because the inhabitants wanted to escape harassment from the Incas, now they are mostly just tourists. In fact, most of the inhabitants live in Puno, and come out to the islands for the tourists. There is a rotation system in place to make sure each island gets a fair number of visitors.

As one motors into the islands, one can’t help but feel as if they are entering a Peruvian Disneyland. The inhabitants are cheery, wave at the boats, and beckon you to their islands with long sweeping gestures. Once on the island you are greeted with a hearty hello in the native language and enthusiastically encouraged to snap as many pictures as you want.

The guide sits everyone down and they launch into a mini-demonstration of how the islands are built. The bottoms of the islands are made of a cork-like material, then reeds are piled cross-thatch style on top of those pieces. Theses many little pieces are then lashed together and anchored to the bottom of the lake. The lake is shallow where the islands are located. After the demonstration you are invited into a house, where you can take more pictures, and then are ushered outside to the view all the goods available for sale. After being plied to buy the trinkets, you are then offered a ride, for a small fee of course, on a large boat that looks like a Viking ship but is made out of reeds. After the floating islands you are piled back into the motor boat to begin the journey into the main lake and the island of Taquile.

The trip from the floating islands, in a protected inlet, to the main lake takes about 2.5 hours. Most people fall asleep due to the slow rocking of the boat. The boat actually drives barely above no-wake speed, which I have to wonder is done on purpose to lengthen the trip. I mean, there really isn’t any surf and barely any wind, but either way, we got there, if not slowly. Upon arrival at the island, one is greeted with a sign that has a few instructions, only one of which is really worth repeating “Don’t feed the children candy”. When I read that I thought it sounded more like don’t feed the wildlife, they might become accustomed to the food and not want to hunt their own food anymore. Honestly, I think candy isn’t the issue. Any kid on the island is trying to sell you things, not take candy from you.

After the sign and entrance, we climbed a short path to the house of a typical family. Once at the house, the family performed a dance and then drug up a few people to dance with them. I was lucky enough for that to happen. I realized that as soon as they were looking they would target me, I was sitting close to the front and appeared young and willing. See video to watch me embarrass myself. Apparently the translation of the song being sung was mostly “Kiss me, Kiss me”. Oh boy.

After the dance we were served a lunch of soup and trout. It was actually quite good, especially compared to what I was used to. Following lunch we continued up the slope to the top of the island and the plaza. Here in the plaza one is obliged to visit the craft shop and perhaps purchase a few things. The island actually produces a multitude of crafts, which are of very fine quality. I would honestly say that they are the best quality I have seen in Peru. The island is actually quite an interesting place in regards to arts and crafts. There is a hat and pompom system that is used to determine one’s married status and place in the community. If you are a single man, you have a certain hat. If you are a single woman, your pompoms are big.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="BomBoms by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5230356884/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5203/5230356884_ace7b2ef81_z.jpg" alt="BomBoms" width="640" height="425" /></a>
<em>PomPoms</em></p>
If you are a kid, you have a hat that is designed after a flower. If you are the boss of the area, you wear a rainbow hat. The use of this system does make it easy to discern one’s status, but I would imagine also takes the fun out of dating. I mean if you didn’t have to guess whether or not a girl had a boyfriend, where would all the adrenaline go that accompanies the process?

After the plaza, we walked the 2 km around the edge of the island to a different port to get back on our boat. The walk was easy and the path essentially paved. Upon getting to the boat, I tested the water temp and found that it was actually a bit warmer than Tahoe. You could swim in it, I would have if I had a change of clothes, on a warm day if you wanted to. The boat ride back was long and uneventful. Once again the boat puttered along at about the speed I can kayak. Eventually we did get back to town though and were able to return to our hostel. We decided that we were tired of eating carbohydrates in all its various forms that it gets served in Peru, so we ventured to the market (not like super market, like open-air market) and bought a load of vegetables. Liz whipped up a vegetable stir-fry for dinner, which in my opinion was amazing. Although, since my stomach was still a bit touchy, all the forage sent me to the bathroom fairly fast, but I think it was more than worth it.

Although we had only been in Puno for a day, we had exhausted most of its attractions by visiting the lakes. In fact, Puno’s similarity to Huaraz, did not entice me to linger longer. The next day we would be traveling to Cusco via bus. There is a well-known train that runs the route as well, but for about 220$ per person. Liz and I opted for the bus which costs 12$ per person, and follows the same path. While the Islands in LT were touristy, they were very interesting and possess a culture that does not exist in any other parts of the world.
