I woke up in the morning feeling weak and nauseous. Now, some people in our group had elected to pay for mules to cart them up the canyon. If you were in my situation feeling bad and faced with a 1000m+ uphill hike, would you consider getting a mule? That is what I thought, you would not. You have pride and would never consider such a thing. At least, that is what went through my head. Instead, Liz slowly walked me up the canyon. We went at a snail’s pace, since I felt weak and needed to take lots of stops. Eventually the people riding the mules passed us; one of the girls smoking a cigarette in the process.  Did I contemplate stopping one of them to ask for help? Nope!

As the climb continued, my pace became slower and slower. I am very lucky that Liz is so patient. She did not hassle me about being slow. She stayed with me the whole way, although shaking her head at why I was doing this. She repeatedly asked me to give her my pack, but I refused. If I was going to hike up, even sick, I was going to do it with my own pack. Often times she mumbled under her breath about stupid man pride, or something like that, I chose to ignore it and focus on putting one foot in front of the other. As we neared the top, my situation actually worsened. I had to stop at one point to answer nature’s call. The hard part about that is the trail was the only flat thing to stand on, so I pushed aside some rocks and made sure Liz held up anybody coming behind us.

<em>Feeling not so good</em></p>
After about 3 hours we reached the top. While most people were celebrating at this point, I was merely trying to keep myself composed. After resting a bit, we took off for the 15 minute walk over flat ground to town. While this should normally be the easiest part for anybody, it turned out to be the hardest for me. My stomach decided to kick into overdrive and it felt like someone was twisting my intestines. I was able to walk for about a minute before I had to sit down. Eventually we were able to reach the edge of town and I rushed into the first place with a bathroom. As for what happened in there, well, take whatever you’re imagining and double it.

After I finished up, we walked the next three blocks to the restaurant where we were supposed to have brekkie. I simply laid down outside on the sidewalk, dust be damned. Liz cradled my head in her lap like a baby, and the others in the group were genuinely concerned. Mei offered me some apricots, which I guess I thought might be a good idea to try and eat, although I had no appetite. However, within about a minute of them hitting my stomach I projectile vomited into the gutter. Let me clarify a bit more, I vomited green. The upside to having vomited was that I actually felt a lot better and was able to stand up after that. I joined the group inside for brekkie, and gave away the food that was supposed to be mine. I opted to only drink powerade.

After brekkie, we got into our van and began the drive back towards Arequipa. Along with the tour, we are supposed to stop along the way to see a few sights. However, the road we found was soon blocked by a truck that could not make it up the hill. Therefore, we had to detour to the other side of the canyon, which slightly prolonged our journey. I was mostly delirious, so it was not a big deal for me. Our first stop was at some hot springs close to Chivay, where all in the group, except me, bathed in nice hot spring water. I figured that the last thing I wanted to do was subject my digestive system to a steam bath.

When everyone was clean and bathed, we drove into Chivay for a buffet lunch. I opted for crackers instead, not wanting to push my luck. When lunch was finished, we piled back into the van for the drive back to Arequipa. The only stop we had was at the top of the pass, 4910m, to view the surrounding volcano peaks. It was a short stop because it was freezing out and we did not linger for long. This was the last stop on our drive back, and before we knew it we were saying our goodbyes to our new friends and going our separate ways. While I had suffered the last day, the overall trip was an awesome, irreplaceable experienc. The group was great and made the trip one that will never be forgotten.
