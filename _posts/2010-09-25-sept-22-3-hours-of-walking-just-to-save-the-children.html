Today was another day spent in the small village of Llanca. I was up at 6am, at the school by 645 to wash my face (remember I haven’t showered yet) and this is a good time to begin another tale. It must be noted that up until this point, I have had no food except potatoes, rice, and fried eggs. Now if you know your food groups, this means I haven’t had anything but starch (technically the egg is protein, but seriously?). Now this means something very important, no fiber and no protein (I don’t count the egg) in my diet for the past few days. Think about what this might do to a person’s digestive system. If you’re thinking about the inability to use the bathroom (#2), then you’d definitely be on the right track. After washing my face, I tried to use the bathroom. Emphasis on tried, because I did not succeed. Now understand, I’ve never had this problem in my life. It was a new feeling trying to use the bathroom, pushing with all my might, eyes pooping, tears down my cheeks, and nothing. Absolutely nothing. It was very depressing.

After my failed attempt to use the bathroom, I was forced to eat breakfast. Can you guess what it was? YUP, potatoes, rice, and a fried egg, BUT there was also this delicious liquid cereal. I don’t remember the name, but I think it was some sort of grain (like Quinoa) with sugar and water. Delicious! However, my happiness was quelled slightly by thought that my intestines were quickly running out of room. 

After breakfast it was back to the school for a day with the older kids. This group was much more savvy with the XOs, especially the teacher. We worked with the Charlar activity, using it to create a typing competition. It was really great. In the afternoon we worked with Memorizar. The students were able to play the game quite well, utilizing the mesh network to play together.

After the school day, I had lunch with another student, who lived quite a bit away. Once again I ate, yup, potatoes, rice, and an egg. They wanted to give me some more food. But I just couldn’t eat it. My insides felt completely full. After lunch, I made my way back to school. I gathered my things and began my 3 hour trot to the next village. The two teachers accompanied me about halfway. I think I walked about 6 miles, including a 800 down/up in elevation. Needless to say I was completely wiped when I got to the next school. 

Upon my arrival at the next school of Mantuas, I found the parents in the school house drinking like fish. They (about 13) had gone through about 3 crates of 12 (1L) bottles. I was disturbed and impressed. Nevertheless, I was given a seat with a huge plate of food. Now before you think I say that I’m going to have potatoes, you’d only be half right. I had Cuy (guinea pig) and potatoes with a pepsi. I ate all the meat, not because I wanted it, but in the hope that it might help relieve my bathroom issue. After dinner I ventured to the bathroom to give things a go. Now, I thought I had been pushing hard in the morning, but this put that to shame. I was pushing so hard, that I was burping up my dinner. Needless to say, I did not have any success. At this point, I was really getting worried. 

I headed back to the school room, to join in some beer drinking. The way they drink it is with one glass shared, passed person to person much as a joint would be (it’s the closest analogy I could think of, sorry Mom and Dad). After a bit, I was so tired I excused myself to sleep in the next room (storage room). 

If I thought I was to have a peaceful night, I was wrong. Apparently I had come down with a cold too. I had a terribly fitful night of night sweats and freezing. I had to get up multiple times to pee (not normal for me), although not for #2, which is what I was hoping for. Eventually I was able to sleep for a couple peaceful hours…
