Liz and I were both up at 6am today. Don’t ask why, we don’t know either. However, it allowed us to get an early start on the day. We were out the door by 8am and by 930am had already booked our train tickets to Machu Pichu, bought the tourist ticket that would allow us to visit a myriad of museums and ruins in the area and the sacred valley, and arranged a ATV tour for the next day.

After being so efficient by this time of the morning, we decided that we would spend a good part of the day seeing the four ruin sites close to town. We grabbed a taxi to the farthest ruin, which would allow us to walk back towards town stopping at the ruins along the way. The ruins themselves were fairly impressive and varied. The first we visited was a bathing place. The second a fortress to protect the bathing place. The third a ritual center with a cave cut out of the rocks. The last was a monolithic fortress that was extremely large. Since we had walked about 4 miles by the time we had reached the last place, we were somewhat exhausted. So we found a quiet place where we could lie down on some nice grass and take a nap. We later found out after wandering through the place, that we had actually taken a nap in the cemetery, which explained why it was so quiet.

After the ruins, and about 5 hours of sight-seeing and walking between the ruins, we walked back to town where we bought food to make dinner. We returned to the hostel where we took a chance to rest our feet, catch up on the internet, and make dinner. Liz actually came down with an upset stomach so we did not do much the rest of the night except watch TV and make the occasional run to the bathroom. The day overall was interesting and exciting, including the excitement brought on by stomach pain!
