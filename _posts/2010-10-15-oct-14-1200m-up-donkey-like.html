Today I was up around 6am and ready by 7am. By 710 one of the kids had shown up to escort me to his house. I took a picture of his shirt because it was John Cena, and not only was this awesome but also totally baffling as to how that shirt ended up in Peru.

<em>John Cena!</em></p>
After breakfast, it was to work with the kids. We worked on a variety of activities and since this group was so quick, I had actually prepared new material the night before. We did a quick review to reinforce concepts, then we worked on some new concepts. However, the power disappeared around 9am and consequently we were out of batteries by 1030. So, we took a recess for an hour, but upon our return, the power had yet to return. Therefore, I got inventive and did a english language workshop. I drew a picture of a person (okay, it was a stick person) on the board along with labels for body parts. Then we played a simpler version of Simon Says. The seemed to like it as they continued to be confused. We kept this up for about 3o minutes, when miraculously the power came back on. We were able to work for another 30 minutes on the laptops before the end of the day.

After class, I ate lunch quickly and grabbed my bags for the walk to Pampas Grande. Jhonaton, a super inquisitive and nice kid, accompanied me for about 1.5hours of the journey.

I had to walk first back to Huanlla to meet up with the teacher there. I got to take a quick rest while he got his things together.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Resting by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5083943649/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/5083943649_4d047670b8_z.jpg" alt="Resting" width="640" height="480" /></a>

From Huanlla we made our way slowly up the mountain, all 1200m of it, to Pampas Grande. We had to stop to take a couple breaks because the paths are extremely steep. Plus, I was carrying two packs, one with my living stuff and the other with the tech stuff. I was able to find a couple of sticks to help with the walking business, however walking still got slowly got more difficult as the day wore on. Somehow the teacher manages to do this weekly. I think I'd kill myself first.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Hike by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5084532054/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5084532054_d558b824f1_z.jpg" alt="Hike" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Hike</em></p>
We got to Pampas Grande around 6, and since the teacher had a stomach ache, we only had tea and bread for dinner. The bus was scheduled to leave around 2am, so we clambered in and slept for a bit until it did. This was about 730pm. By 1130pm I was wide awake, freezing (remember Pampas is at 3600m) and starving. To add to this, I think the blanket they gave me had fleas, because I was extremely itchy. I busted out my camp stove and made oatmeal. The teacher thought I was crazy, but I did not care. After the food, I was able to fall in and out of sleep until the bus started filling up with people for the trip to Huaraz. I got back to Huaraz around 730am where I promptly made for the hotel so that I could take a shower. One has to realize, the paths we are walking on are full of dust and when you sweat, dust sticks. I looked and smelled terrible. This was probably the reason I didn't have anybody sitting next to me on the bus....
