****ATTENTION: Over the next week (M-F) I will most likely be out of contact (won't have internet). I sincerely apologize for this, but please know that if I do have internet I will make sure to post. Most likely I will not be able to do much until I return on Friday.****

Whoa, been here over two weeks. Feels way longer :P

Today was a nice easy going sunday. Got up and worked on some things until around 1030 when I couldn't ignore my stomach anymore and needed to go get food. I had decided earlier in the week that on Sunday I would treat myself to a nice breakfast. I headed over to the California Cafe, a popular backpacker hangout, for a good hearty breakfast. I got a two toast, home fries, scramble (cheese and ham), and tomatoes. Also orange juice and coffee/tea was included. It was a good amount of food, and it tasted GOOD. I decided to get the Coca Tea. Thats coca as in COCAine. That's right, the leaves are the same thing as that powder stuff (ok well not exactly). After drinking a couple of cups of the stuff, I definitely had a head buzz (which was not expected). I spent a good chunk of the morning at the Cafe working on my lappy.

Around 1230 I head over to the Archeological Museum. I went here based on the recommendation of my guide book and let me say that the book highly over exaggerated. This was about a 3 room and courtyard area of weak photos and few artifacts. This was definitely not worth my time or money. The museum back in Lima was much better. My recommendation for anyone in the area, don't waste your time. Go hiking instead. 

After the museum I returned back to my hotel for a bit. Worked some more and then headed out to find lunch. In addition to lunch I bought some mini bananas (10 for .3$) to snack on later and the next day. They are quite tasty. After lunch, which wasn't that spectacular because my favorite cafe was closed, I returned to the hotel to pack my things for the upcoming week and relax.

Tomorrow I will be up for a 330am rendezvous and ride of about 2 hours into the Cordillera Negra.
