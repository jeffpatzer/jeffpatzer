A quick post, because I don't have much time. Last night we came from Huaraz to Trujillo. Got here super early, 7am. We are staying with a nice fellow via CouchSurfers. He spent the majority of the day showing us around the town. Tonight we're going out to see some of his friends. I'll write a longer more detailed post tomorrow when I have more time!

I'm having a great time, alive, and doing well. Also, starting soon, I'm going to start releasing a multi-part series on my experiences with OLPC and how the program is actually doing. Whether it is really making a difference or not. Stay on the lookout! Sorry I don't have an exact date, but I'm still working on it :/
