I met the teacher with whom I would be traveling with around 730am. We took a short combi ride out of Huaraz into the foothills to the east. The ride was short and when we got off, the walk was equally as short. Essentially, I did not have to sweat, work, or try hard at all to get to my destination. I was absolutely baffled.

The school I visited had only three students, only two of which were old enough to have laptops. Another intern had visited the school during the summer, so the kids were what I considered advanced. However, my workshops were still applicable and I was able to teach them new things. I always want to make sure that what I am teaching is new, because it makes no sense for me to repeat myself. Unfortunately there is no electricity at the school and as a result we could only work until about 1230pm. After this the teacher and I walked the short distance back to the road, caught a Combi back to Huaraz, and I was back in the city by 145pm. Not bad considering my previous travel experiences.

Once back in town it was a relaxing afternoon, except the internet at the hotel did not work very well. As a result I couldnâ€™t get this post up sooner. Hope, Josh, and myself relaxed and did not do too much work. It was a good change of pace!
