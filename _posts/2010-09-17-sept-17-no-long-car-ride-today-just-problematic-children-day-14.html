Today I didn't have to get up early for the 1.5hour car ride in the Cordillera Negra, although I was up at 6am. Now why was I up at this point? Because some person next door to my room decided they needed to play their guitar. Seriously. 

I ended up not having to leave the hotel until around 9am for a school only a few minutes from the town center. I ended up working with these kids (5 of them) that were just out of control. The teacher disappeared as soon as the laptops came out and the kids turned into a wild herd of cats. I couldn't really discipline them so I was struggling to find something to do that would really capture their attention. I went through a slew of things on the laptops and eventually found that I was able to keep them entertained using the Charlar (or chat) activity. We were able to set up a small chat activity between the kids and the concentration needed to use the keyboards kept them quiet for a while. Although the kids were out of control, I don't blame them. Rather, its the teacher who I think is the culprit. I didn't feel like I was able to accomplish much with the kids because they were too rambunctious. I guess not everyday will be a winner. 

After the school I went back to my hotel for a couple of hours to work on reports. Around 4 I went with the specialist (organizer) to talk with the teachers about my schedule for next week. Looks like I'll be out of touch during the week because I'll be staying in the villages. They are too far away to transit too and from. I don't know if I'll have any internet or what my living situation will be like. Things should be interesting :)

After talking to the teachers, I headed over to my new favorite cafe to hang out and listen to the Cal football game. A pretty quiet Friday night, which after my busy week, is just fine with me :)
