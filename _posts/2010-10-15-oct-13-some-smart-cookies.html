Today I was up extra early at 530am and out the door by 615am. I was able to make the ‘short’ trek to La Victoria in about 30 minutes, luckily it was early enough (cold enough) that I didn’t work up too much of a sweat. Granted this was all downhill, so going back should be a bit more interesting. I will consider it a warm-up for the three hour walk to Pampas Grande.

Anyways, I arrived at the school, but I was a bit early. I ended up talking to one of the students, probing the kid for information on how much the use the laptops, when they use them, what they do with them, and so on. This is a good way to anticipate the type of day I have ahead of me. However, I got super lucky with this school, because the kids totally rock with the laptops. 

The teacher came around and was extremely enthusiastic. I got a really good vibe from her. She sent me on my way for breakfast after letting me drop my bags. We started class around 8am and I soon found out that these kids use their laptops a lot. They were extremely comfortable with them and so far were the most knowledgeable of any school I’ve visited. However, the still didn’t know basic things like how to copy text and photos to the clipboard. Still, there were signs that these kids were pretty ahead of the curve. One girl (the teacher’s daughter) had an external usb mouse and the kids had already dabbled in Scratch and Turtle Art, two of the most advanced activities in the laptop. Either way, I was able to teach them some new things, and all of the kids were attentive and easy to work with, even the second graders. Once again, I’ve found it’s more about the teacher’s attitude than necessarily the type of kids in the school. If given encouragement and the freedom to learn, the kids will learn. 



Anyways the day went by quite quickly. At recess, when the kids are normally given their government provided PapaPan, it appeared the bread had not been delivered. Considering the kids needed to be able to focus and were probably extremely hungry, I divided up the loaf of bread that I had with me between the kids. I think it was the first time they had tasted wheat bread. Most of bread they eat in Peru is flour and water, nothing more. They call it Pancito (pan means bread and ito means cute or little) and I think this is because it has little flavor. On another note, I got to watch some bulls fight during lunchtime. The owner called it playing…I describe it as a precursor to animal rage.

We took a break for lunch at 1. I accompanied one of the students to their house for lunch, coincidentally the house with the bulls. They are a nice family and the dad insisted I watch a running of the bulls video with him before I left. This was essentially their version of youtube. We watched people get trampled and gored. Eventually he told me that they have a “running” every year in the village. I’m glad it won’t be when I am around for it. 

After lunch I worked with the kids again from 3-5pm. The time flew by considering they were learning new things and really were interested in learning. After class, I played with the kids a bit, soccer as usual. I talked with the parents a bit and eventually was shuttled off for dinner. The teacher, her daughter, the matron who cooked dinner, and myself had a nice chat after dinner. We talked about all the deadly things they find in their houses, like snacks and spiders. Luckily, I’m sleeping in the school house tonight, which is mostly concrete, so I should be a bit safer than the mud huts…hopefully. Also, I offered to help make dinner, which was greeted by hearty laughter. I think that men just about never do any of the cooking. Shoot, in some houses I’ve visited only the guys eat at the table, while the women eat near the stove on the ground. Please don’t hate me feminists, I’m just telling it as it is, and most of the time this isn’t the case. 
After the meal I meandered the 500 yards, or the length of the town, back to the school to get ready for the next day and go to sleep. Overall, a very productive and rewarding day, hopefully tomorrow goes the same way!

The whole class
