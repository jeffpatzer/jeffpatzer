I woke up this morning around 530am, because well that’s when the sun comes out. It was difficult to force myself out of my warm sleeping bag (on top of the sheep skins) as it was bitterly cold. It was cold enough that I did not bother washing my face or hair, because that would have meant putting water on my face and losing any warmth I had. I settled for wearing my hat all day.

After breakfast, the school day began. The teacher taught the kids for the first 1.5hours and after this I took over until the end of the day. Beyond the normal workshops I normally run, nothing was too out of the ordinary. Except, for the fact that every time we ate food throughout the day, I had to go and use the bathroom immediately afterwards (it wasn’t pretty so I’ve omitted details, you’re welcome).  The other thing that was a bit odd was our recess snack, which consisted of anchovies, potatoes, and rice. It actually wasn’t that bad, and hey, it was protein.

After school, one of the mother delivered lunch which was the standard rice and potatoes. I chatted with the teacher for a bit, took a stroll up the hill to get a look around, and generally killed time until it got dark. Along with the loss of light, also went any warmth as it cooled down to a brisk 2 degrees Celsius (only to get colder as the night wore on). At night, once again we watched a movie. We actually had a double feature. While this sounds amazing let me explain that all the movies they buy are illegal copies, bad illegal copies. Skipping, fuzzy pictures, bad audio, and all sorts of other things plague the DVDs. However, the DVD quality was overshadowed by the movie choices for the evening.

Our first feature was a Peruvian film centering on life in the countryside, when a village is attacked by a brain eating zombie. Disregarding the terrible film quality (acting, sound, lighting, pretty much everything), the story itself was just ridiculous. It centers on a village not unlike the one I am in that is attacked by a zombie that spits on you to mesmerize you, then eats the back of your head. Of course all was going well, until the towns people caught him and beat the crap of him. The zombie got a few people though before they took him out. The kids were scared, and I think so were the adults, although they might have been trying to hide it.

After Peruvian zombie movie, to lighten the mood, we watched a Samson and Hercules movie from the 60’s where the two legends take on some sort of kingdom. The special effects were hokey and the acting terrible, and once again I had to wonder how much of the story was lost on the people. I mean, how are they supposed to know that Hercules and Samson are mythic figures with tremendous strength? I think that the people merely assumed they were supposed to be really strong guys, but they enjoyed it and laughed anyways.

After the movies, I once again returned to my sheep skin bed to pass out. However the night would not pass silently, as a decent earthquake shook the building around 130am in the morning. It was strong enough that I woke up before it fully hit, was thoroughly concerned while it was shaking a mud brick school house (which I was sleeping in), and small enough that it only lasted about 15 seconds. Upon not getting pulled out of bed by the teacher, I assumed it was safe to go back to sleep. And that is what I did, I went back to sleep.
