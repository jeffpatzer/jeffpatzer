Today I was up at 530am as usual and by 630am was bounding my way to school (imagine Bambi). Since we didn’t have anything to cook breakfast with, we ate an onion/tuna salad with soda crackers. While this doesn’t sound that good, it was similar to a tuna sandwich, until the crackers ran out.

With the kids, I finished up making a game in scratch (originally designed by Josh, nice job Josh). We only worked until 1145am since we had to be back in Cajamarquilla for the 1pm combi back to Huaraz. However, since I had already been at the school for two days, and normally I only have about 2 or 1.5 days, I felt like I had all the time in the world. We were able to get through a lot of stuff, but more importantly, the teacher was a somewhat young lady and was interested in knowing more. Since she knew how to use the internet, I gave her a list of sites to visit as well as instruction to search google for more ideas. Hopefully she follows through.

The combi left around 130pm, rather than the 1pm time originally intended. I listened to my iPod most of the way, mostly just to drown out the Huaino (not sure of the spelling here, but pronounced Wino), music that continually blares from the radios here. It’s terrible and makes me want to kill people. One of the teachers riding back with us to Huaraz told me he had some trouble with a USB stick of his. We agreed to meet later that night so that I could help him troubleshoot. It turned out that his issue was solved with a simple formatting because the drive had become corrupted. He was incredulous and couldn’t believe that it was now working. I told him that it must be because I was good luck, but this was only because I couldn’t communicate the idea that I had magic powers. That would have been more epic. Sigh.

The rest of the night was spent at dinner and on the internet. Of course, after being away for a few days, I needed my fix! While this week was not full of walking, my stomach ordeal and nearly passing out due to inhalation of plastic fumes, kept things plenty interesting.
