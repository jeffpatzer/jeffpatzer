Liz and I departed Ica around 8pm and spent the night sleeping on the bus, which never results in a truly great night’s sleep. This could be due to the uncomfortable seats, the loud crappy movie, or just the young punks sitting in front of you that want stop talking. Upon arriving in Arequipa on the Friday the 26<sup>th</sup> of November, Liz and I took a taxi to the hostel that we had booked. On a side note, we’ve started using a site called hostelbookers.com which provides an easy way to sift through places and read reviews. The hostel we chose was Marlon’s House Arequipa, and it was a very good choice. It is an extremely clean hostel with fairly decent amenities. They are part of a chain, but this does not detract from the value they offer. We got a private room for 6$ per person, with a shared bathroom. One of the best things about hostels is they are really flexible on the time you arrive, which means if you take a night bus and get into town around 8am they won’t bug you about check-in time.

After dropping of our bags, it was still very early in the morning, we went in search of food. We settled on a Middle Eastern place called Fez’s Café, which had amazing falafel. Their falafel was absolutely top-notch and if you find yourself in Arequipa, Peru, I highly recommend it.

Since Arequipa is close to what is called the Colca Canyon, a canyon deeper than the grand canyon, we decided that we would do a trek in the canyon. These treks are quite popular and there are a myriad of tour companies all within a few blocks of one another. After checking with a bunch of companies, in search of the best price, we decided to actually go with our hostel’s tour company. They offered the best price, plus with the added convenience of being able to leave our bags at the hostel, it was the easiest route.

After arranging our trek, a 3Day/2Night excursion, we spent the rest of the afternoon looking around Arequipa. Arequipa, in my opinion, is the nicest city in Peru. It is clean, orderly, pretty, and cultured. The architecture is a beautiful colonial style made mostly out of Sillar stone (a volcanic stone readily available in the surrounding area). The residents walk around with the trendiest new fashions. However, and this is the most important part, the food is the best I’ve had in Peru.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Arequipan Plaza by donJEFE, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffpatzer/5225551040/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5209/5225551040_59c3f0ae15_z.jpg" alt="Arequipan Plaza" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<em>Arequipan Plaza</em></p>
For sight-seeing we visited the Santa Catalina Monastery, a prison for Nuns, I mean a place of worship. It is a megalith of a complex that is only partly used now by a group of about 39 prisoners, sorry, Nuns. The architecture is very colonial and the layout is much like a small city. Rooms tended to be very Spartan and accompanied with a small place for a wood fire. After the monastery, we visited the Plaza de Armas and the main market. The market was quite impressive as it houses a huge amount of fruits, veggies, hat stalls, huge variety of nic-nacs, ready to eat empanadas &amp; papa rellenos, fresh juice stations, and of course the meat butcher stations (which don’t smell so nice).

We decided to do dinner at a restaurant where we could eat some typical Arequipan dishes. Liz and I settled on a place that offered us free Pisco Sours, essentially the national drink of Peru, and ordered two typical dishes. We ordered Roccoto Relleno and Adobo. The Rocotto Relleno is a stuffed rocotto pepper served with a potato covered in cheese, very delicious. The Adobo was a slow braised piece of pork with a delicious sauce that I sopped up using the bread. We were VERY satisfied with the meal.

After dinner we retired to the hostel for an early night because we were going to have to get up at 245am the following morning for the 330am pickup for our trek. We did not have trouble going to sleep early though, considering the prior night had been spent on a bus, which never results in a good night’s sleep :)
