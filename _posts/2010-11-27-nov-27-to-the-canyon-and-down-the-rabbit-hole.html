Our Colca Canyon trek began early on Saturday morning at about 245am. We were up and finished packing for the 330am pickup. When the van arrived we groggily got in. The van proceeded to pick up the other people that would be joining us on the trek. Many hostels organize the 3D/2N trek and then pool the people into a group. As the van slowly filled, we gave each other tired, awkward hellos. Eventually, everybody was accounted for and the 3 hour drive to the canyon was underway.

On the ride there, most people drifted in and out of sleep. Beyond the initial hello and pep talk given to us by our guide, we really did not talk much. Around 7am, we arrived in Chivay which is a sleepy mountain town at about 3600m. We were served breakfast here and stocked up on various supplies like water and snacks (mostly chocolate it seemed). After a decent breakfast, we were shuttled off to the Condor Lookout, which is a point in the canyon where one can view the canyon and the condors that live in it.

This is a very busy area full of tourists waiting to see the elusive bird flying around. Luckily we were able to see a couple of the birds while there. They are actually quite massive.

The canyon itself was also quite beautiful, and although deeper than the Grand Canyon in the USA, its walls are not as steep and its colors not as vibrant. It makes it a more hospitable place, allowing people to live there, but in my opinion slightly less breath-taking than the Grand Canyon.

<em>Do Not Pass</em></p>
After our time at the lookout, we shuttled off down the road towards the town of Cabanaconde. At this point we met our guide, Chemi (his real name is Ricardo), and although it was only 10am, were served lunch. After our lunch, around 1130am, we began our trek. Now while I normally won’t complain about stopping to eat, it did happen to mean that we had to start our walk when the sun was essentially at its peak.

After lunch, we began walking through a series of fields to reach the canyon rim. After about 20 minutes we got to the edge and were able to assess the task in front of us. Chemi informed us that our downward mission would take about 3 hours. Now while I have quite a bit of experience with walking in Peru (see previous two months of posts), many of the people on the trek did not. You could see the fear in their eyes and excitement on their faces. Chemi, knowingly looking at the three guys on the trek, told us that there is only one path down and there is a bridge at the bottom, and if anybody got there quickly, they should wait at the bridge. With those words in mind we plunged off down the trail.

Soon enough I found myself walking with the two other guys, both British fellows, at the front of the group with quite a gap between us and the rest of the group. The trail itself was dusty and rocky, but nothing I had not encountered before. John and Eric, mid-20s financial advisers, had recently finished the Inca Trail and did not find the Colca descent too challenging either. In fact, despite the three hours it took to get to the bridge, time flew as we discussed a myriad of topics (credit cards, American politics, British politics, to name a few).

Liz was walking in the middle of the pack with an Australian-Thai girl named Mae. They found the trail a bit more difficult, but also felt time fly as they discussed their various lives. Mae had lived in Thailand for the past three years, where she had taught English, built a house, and then sold it to finance her next bout of travels to another continent. They reached the bridge about 10 minutes after we did. Right before them, a trio of French girls arrived. Mary, Mary, and Melin had spent the last few weeks or so between a few south American countries. Bringing up the tail was Suzanna, a writer from Australia, and Gloria, and elderly lady from Spain, along with Chemi.

After we assembled at the bridge, we walked the next 15 minutes to our camp. I use the word camp loosely, because it was more like a lodge. It had hot water, rooms with windows, a big room where we could hang out, I mean, after having roughed it in the Cordillera Negra, this was like heaven. Once at the lodge, we all took showers, relaxed, stretched, and then spent the rest of the night playing cards. After having walked downhill for so long, everybody’s knees felt a little wobbly.

<em>Roy's Lodge at the end of the day</em></p>
Lucky for John, he found a new friend in the local dog, Bobby. In fact, John may have become a little too close to the dog. John claims the sounds we heard during the night were them playing, but who really knows.

Considering the lodge had no electricity, we all turned in relatively early. This was partly due to the candles running out and partly due to us having to wake up early. Our first day in the Colca Canyon had come to a close.

The next two days are to come soon...
