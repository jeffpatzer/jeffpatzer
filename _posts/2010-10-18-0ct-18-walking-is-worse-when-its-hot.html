Today I was up extremely early, like 2:45am early. While walking to the bus, I saw this -

I was on a bus that was leaving Huaraz by 4am and in Pariacoto at 715am. I had put my backpack in the back compartment of the bus, which I had thought would be better than on top in terms of dust, but oh how wrong I was. I pulled my backpack out to find it absolutely coated. Note to self, don’t do that again! Well I did what I could and brushed off my bag, then went about hunting down directions to Vinchota. Vinchota, the town I will be working in over the next two days is just outside of Pariacoto by about a 40minute walk, uphill and in what is best described as a desert. Needless to say I found the directions from some locals, confirmed along the way, and was able to meander my way to the school. By the time I arrived I was soaking wet, because the sun was up and it was quite warm. So I changed shirts, put on some more deodorant, and called it good. 

The teacher greeted me at the door and promptly informed me that he had seen me walking as he was driving his moto to the school, but wasn’t sure who I was so didn’t stop to give me a lift. Well, whatever, I got to the school it not fashionably late, then fashionably sweaty. I soon found out that he only has 8 students, but 5 of them are missing, so this really means that he has 3 students, all under age 8. This means that basic things like using the mouse are a challenge. However, did I let this stop me from dominating in the teaching realm? No, it did not. 
We worked with a variety of activities, and I use the word worked loosely, struggled through is more like it. But we got through them, they learned some new things and by lunch time all parties were in need of a good nap. I caught a ride with the teacher back in his moto, which was easier than walking, although significantly more nerve racking. 

We made it back to town without any hassles and I was shown to a place for lunch. Luckily it was restaurant, so the normal potatoes and rice was a bit more spiced up. I even got a piece of pork, yum. I went back to the room I was given, at the aunt’s house, to take a nap (remember I got up early, don’t judge). After my nap I took a 10min walk around the town to see it, this is all that was required because it’s not very large. I, of course, got stared at by everyone which is normal. I just try to look friendly and hope they assume I am. I think mostly what they are contemplating is “Where the hell did he come from?”, sometimes I wonder the same thing. 
Either way, I grabbed some dinner which was more of the same fare. During dinner a local was talking to me about how Pariacoto is the best city on earth. They have the best apples. They have the smartest people. BUT, and I mean BUT, the government doesn’t help them. So they can’t develop a industry for their amazing apples. And their super smart people can’t get educated because they don’t have a university. Essentially, if the government did something, Pariacoto would take over the world. His solution was to have a new library built so that they’d have better books. *On a side note, I haven’t seen anyone reading for fun. No one.* I tried to explain that they have the internet, which is better. However, I don’t think he understood that. Anyways, interesting conversation nevertheless. 

After dinner, I headed to the teacher’s house to confirm details for the next day. What I found out is he also happens to run the town radio station. I got to see their set-up, which would make any aspiring rapper in the south proud. They have egg cartons on the walls to dampen sound, a very small sound mixing board, and an extremely old PC for playing the songs. It is impressive actually that they run a radio station out of the guy’s living room essentially. His bed is behind a sheet! However, what this put into perspective was why he has a car (albeit it is broken down at the moment) and a moto. He’s a teacher during the morning, and a DJ during the afternoon.  Which is a great idea considering that most of the teachers only work half a day most of the time. I am never failed to be surprised, just when you assume one thing, you find out its completely different. After touring the “station” I headed back and went to bed early.
