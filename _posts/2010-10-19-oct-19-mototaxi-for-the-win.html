Today was pretty standard. I got up around 6am, got ready, and was out the door around 7am. Today, now that I knew who the teacher was, I was able to ride in his moto-taxi. This was pretty fun (scary), I was able to get interesting video of it. The teacher brought his 9 year old son along so that he could spend the day learning with me. I worked on various activities with the kids, splitting the 4 kids into two groups (older and younger). This way I could tailor activities appropriately for their age group. The day passed smoothly enough and soon we were heading back to Pariacoto in the moto-taxi. I grabbed lunch, played with the teacherâ€™s son a bit, walked around the town some more, and settled in back at my room to read a bit and work. I ate a snack with the teacher and chatted with him a bit. A real nice fellow. 

I headed back to my room to get ready to leave in the morning and went to sleep. Overall a fairly quiet, non-crazy day.
