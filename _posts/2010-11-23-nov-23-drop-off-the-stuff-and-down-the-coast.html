Today we repacked all our bags, consolidating things down to the bare minimum. We then left about half of our stuff at a friends place in Lima. We were able to eat some lunch at an indian restaurant, which was quite delicious. Although not as delicious as Anu's mom's food. After lunch we grabbed our things and made our way to the bus terminal. We boarded a bus and headed down to Pisco (a town that shares the same name as the peruvianÂ liquor. We got to the town around 9pm, got a hotel, and then made arrangements to go to see the Islas Balestas tomorrow. It is called the "Poor Man's Galapagos".

The town of Pisco is a bit sad. It experienced a terrible earthquake in 2007 and is still rebuilding. Many things are still ruined and it adds a very somber note to the whole area.
