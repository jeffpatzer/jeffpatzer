The trip from Puno to Cusco can be done in three ways. The first is to fly, almost no one does this due to price. The second is via train, some tourists do this, but it is very expensive (220$ for a 7 hour ride). The third is by bus, which is the manner most often chosen. The bus follows almost the same line as the train, but at about 1/25 the cost. The road from Puno to Cusco is known to be breathtaking and beautiful. It is for this reason alone that Liz and I decided to do the day bus. Normally I am a fan of the night bus, which allows one to save money and time (you donâ€™t have to stay somewhere and you travel while you sleep). 

The bus left at around 8am and for the first 2 hours or so, the landscape remained similar to the Peru we were already familiar with, dry and rocky. However, after that the scenery changed and became more grassy in appearance, with less rocks, and more water. In fact the closer we got to Cusco the more green the scenery became. The overall bus ride finished a bit earlier than we expected, so we made use of our time in the bus station to book tickets back to Lima. After we had tickets to Lima squared away, we grabbed a taxi and headed to our hostel. 

The odd thing about Cusco, is how the place changes once you reach a certain part of the city. The city center, or where most of the tourist things are located, is a beautiful and quaint little area. The surrounding area outside of the plaza de armas, looks just like any other Peruvian town. One can feel the change as the cross a few streets into the downtown area. The colonial architecture appears and tour operators begin to harass you. For some reason, the people in Cusco think that every tourist wants a massage. If you want through the plaza de armas, you are guaranteed to be offered a massage by about 15 people. This can become very annoying, very fast. 

Liz and I occupied our time for the rest of the afternoon with exploring. We topped off the day with a nice dinner where Liz was able to try Cuy, or guinea pig, for the first time. She seemed to like it, but says that quail or pigeon tastes better. I had alpaca, which looks like chicken but tastes like steak, and is delicious. It makes me want to raise some alpacas, just to eat them!
