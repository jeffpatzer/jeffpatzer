Liz and I took a bus ride that ended up lasting 24 hours from Cusco to Lima. It was cold in the mountains, hot in the desert, and indeterminably long. We've spent the last few days in Lima eating our brains out and relaxing. We are off to Ecuador tomorrow morning where we hope to get some rafting and beach time in.
