This is part 4 of a 6 part series that critically examines my experience in Peru and the situation I encountered.

<em><strong>Note</strong>: I am a graduated engineer that has been taught to think through problems and search for solutions. I am not an expert on Peru and I do not pretend to be. I am drawing on my own experiences and interpretations. My observations span twenty schools and countless interactions with the ministry and teachers over a period of approximately three months. In addition, I often refer to Hope and Josh, but I do not speak for their opinions.</em>
<h1>Software is Only Half the Problem</h1>
While a myriad of software issues plague the laptop, they are accompanied by some equally problematic hardware issues. The first and most problematic problem is the touchpad. For some laptops, the touchpad simply does not function correctly. While trying to move the pointer around, the pointer will jump from one side of the screen to the other, without rhyme or reason. The children will often yell the words “No sirve” or “Se corre” in frustration.  Translated it means, “It doesn’t work” and “It’s (the pointer) running around”. The touchpad problem is exacerbated by the fact that the children rarely bathe and have extremely dirty hands. This causes the touchpads to become very dirty and work even less. One can provide a soft reset of the touchpad using a series of combinations on the keyboard, but it rarely fixes the problem.

<em>Click the mouse!</em></p>
The keyboards are also a big problem. They are built with rubber and are of cheap quality. Therefore, the kids quickly rip keys and have to replace them with tape and draw the letter in.  In addition, actually trying to convey the idea of modifier keys beyond the use of shift and the accent mark, is almost impossible. If you show them one letter and explain that this works for all keys on the keyboard, they will not understand. Some might say this is my fault for not being able to teach them, but really it is more than that. Showing the kids one idea and trying to explain how to extrapolate this to other ideas, just doesn’t work. It’s just not how the kids are taught to learn. They are not encouraged to think outside the box (a phrase which translates but holds no meaning) and problem solve. The teaching method used by the teachers is call and response or copying things from the board. Kids do not work in groups or independently to exercise critical thinking, but rather will only repeat or copy what is given to them by the teacher.
