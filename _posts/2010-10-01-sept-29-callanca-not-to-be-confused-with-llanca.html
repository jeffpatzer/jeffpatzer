I woke up today in the school house, on my bed of sheep (probably not killed long ago based on the feel of the hides :P) and slowly gathered my items. I didn’t really need to pack everything up, but I did so that it was tidy. The teacher got here around 730am and we began with the kids. 

Since the class consists of four grades in one room and with one teacher (this is common to most of the places I’ve visited), I worked with the older kids first and the younger ones second. This was because they are at different stages of understanding and the tasks that we were having them do were different. With the older kids we worked in turtle art (4, 5 grade). With the younger ones we worked with TamTamMini, which is really a program that just lets kids click on things to make noise (1, 2 grade). Nothing extremely out of the ordinary, except for one student. This girl is an absolute whiz. I can show her something once, and she will immediately understand it and help the other students. I’ve got some great pictures of her, so you can she who she is. Her aptitude really blew me away and I hope that she’ll be able to take herself places with it (more on this a bit further down). 

The teacher left around 1pm to head back to Huaraz and I had a few minutes of down time. The kids left for lunch and I relaxed for a bit. The kids returned quickly though (quicker than I anticipated) and we got started on an afternoon session. We worked on a few new activities for them so that they could learn a bit more. My closest approximation to this experience is trying to teach a herd of cats to sit still and do tricks. What a task! Nevertheless we got through things fair enough and I sent the kids home around 445. I had a bit more time to rest before some of the students came back with their cousins. They had brought me some sugar cane, yum but too much work, to munch on. We talked, played some soccer, and I let them play on the XO’s some more while I ate dinner that had been brought to me. Oh and by the way, my meals were mostly the same again today, except for the slight confusion that caused double breakfast to show up, double lunch, and almost double dinner, luckily I was able to avert the over-fooding. That pretty much sums up the day, but I had some thoughts today that I’ve detailed below.

Thoughts on the girl who is super bright: She is awesome with the computer, and I have a feeling that this stretches to other things as well. She is quiet and eager to help. All one could hope for in a student. In short, the type of kid you want to help and see succeed. However, I am constantly wondering what chances she really has. While she does have the XO, she doesn’t have access to the internet. I really wonder if she’ll ever be able to break out of the farm life, married and with kids before 18 cycle that affects many of the girls in the area. While I believe the XO is helping, I really do wonder its long term affects and ability to help kids elevate their lives beyond what their parents know. Which takes me to the next thought.
Thoughts on the older kids that came by later: Two students with their two older cousins came by after the afternoon session. I let the kids play on the laptops, apparently the two older ones (12-14) had used the laptops when they were younger and knew what to do. Seeing them use the laptops it was apparent that they knew how to use the laptop. But that is what they knew, how to use it. How to push the buttons. I have to wonder if what is being taught is how to push the buttons, rather than how to leverage the machine to work for them. I have really come to the conclusion that without the internet these laptops are nothing more than elaborate word processors. The kids aren’t able to reach out into the world beyond and bring it to them. All they know is this is a cool piece of tech that nobody in their village has ever seen. This is not to say that I feel my presence isn’t needed, but I think that the idea of just giving kids laptops in the hopes that they will become masters of it and their universe is indeed naïve. That the laptop is the merely the tool, not the solution. 

Sorry to get all pensive, but when hiking from place to place, one does ponder these things. Below are some AWESOME PHOTOS that I got of the kids.
