Today I was woken up by what sounded like robbers at 530am. I stumbled out into the courtyard of the school to find two students cleaning the school house. I think I scared them as much as they scared me. We exchanged brief hellos, and then they got back to work. Since I was up so early, I went stick hunting. After having slid down the hill yesterday, I promised myself that I would build myself a walking stick that even Gandalf would be jealous of (LOTR reference anyone?). So I hiked up the hill behind the school a bit and soon found a suitable candidate. There a literally hundreds of stick lying around from all the cut down eucalyptus trees, that are used for firewood when it isn’t raining. Eucalyptus makes a fairly good walking stick because the bark comes off quite easily. I spent a good hour working on the stick until a parent showed up to take me to breakfast.

I followed the parent the 5 minute walk to his house (along a goat path on the side of a hill of course) and was soon gorging myself on rice and potatoes, nodding and smiling the whole time to let the parents know how delicious it was. Of course, inside, I was dying a bit wishing I could get a sausage and some proper hash browns. BUT, when people who are extremely poor feed you food, you eat it, you love it, and you tell them every minute how good it is. After breakfast, it was back to the school for the morning lesson.

Since Upacoto also does not have electricity, I quickly decided that the eight students would work in pairs with the screen brightness turned all the way down.

The XO has a pretty neat feature that allows the screen to turn into a black/white screen much like the amazon kindle. This really helps to save battery life. We were able to breeze through a bunch of things before recess. I was working at breakneck speed because I knew that battery life was my enemy. But the kids took it in stride and soaked up everything like sponges. During recess I finished off my walking stick, giving it a sharp point on the top, in case I had to fight any Pumas (or people who took a liking to my bags).

After recess, we breezed through more things and before we knew it, the day was over (at 1pm). I grabbed some lunch with a kid and soon found myself sitting by the creek in the sun reading my book. I spent most of the afternoon here relaxing. Very enjoyable. I spent a couple of hours photographing about four of the students while they played. By darkfall, I had hundreds of photos. The kids were so photogenic I just couldn’t stop myself. Eventually I was led to dinner, where once again I gorged on rice and, wait for it, potatoes. After dinner I meandered back to my room, finished my book and went to sleep around 8pm. It’s hard to stay awake, when you have no electricity to work on your laptop.
