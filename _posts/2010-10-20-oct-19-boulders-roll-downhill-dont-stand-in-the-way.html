Today turned into an interesting day. I was up at 530am and out the door at 615am. Now, why was I up at the time when most people are still contemplating rolling out of bed to make coffee, well it’s because I was on my way to the next village. I needed to travel from Pariacoto to Racrao, which by foot is about an hour (something I would find out later in the day), but only about 10 minutes by Moto-Taxi. I had been told there was a combi or busses to be had, however, after waiting for about 15 minutes at the “curve” I had only seen moto-taxis. I therefore flagged one of these 3-wheeled guys down and jumped in. We took off down the road, coasting on the downhill sections to save gas of course. The thing that struck me was how green the land was becoming. The road is flanked by apple orchards and lots of other fruit plants. The green of course only surrounds the river, but nevertheless, it is in stark contrast to the extremely dusty areas I had already visited. 

I arrived at the small down, think outpost, where I clambered out of the moto and became the immediate center of attention of the people hanging around. I am not unused to this since it happens just about everywhere. I asked for the teacher and was directed to her room, it was a small trudge across the street. I related my story, she vaguely knew who I was, and I was told that I could accompany her students to the school. I crossed back across the street to the group of snicker students, and they promptly began walking to the school. After about 30 seconds I realized the school was not close, but rather up about 300 meters of steep incline. Apparently half of the town is next to the road and the other is up on the ridge, connected by a trail that reminded me closely of the Grand Canyon’s trails. Either way, we trudged up the hill and all arrived panting at the school. 

I was greeted by the second teacher at the school. He began talking to me like I was a Neanderthal, using large arm gestures and grunting noises. Luckily after a bit of talking he realized that I understood Spanish and promptly began communicating using his words. This was nice because it was actually harder to understand him when he was not speaking but merely motioning. I began the day working with the older students and would spend the whole day with them. As usual, the students had recess and they wanted me to play hide and seek with them. So I obliged and we began to hide. Since the school is on a hill, many of the hiding spots are on the incline. Well, I was making my way over the boulders when suddenly they gave way beneath my feet. I very quickly found myself on the downhill side of a large keg sized boulder. As I was trying to regain my footing while sliding down the slope, the boulder was bouncing against my back (not an enjoyable sensation). Luckily I was able to find some footing, spin around with the agility of a mountain lion, and parry the boulder to my side. I then watched it continue to roll down the hill for another few hundred meters. With my back itching with pain from having been smashed a few times by a boulder, the children quickly began to check about my safety. 

At this point I must digress for a second, when I was about 10 my dad was playing baseball with me, my brother, and a bunch of other kids. At one point a kid tried to catch a ball in front of my dad, this kid is now in jail I believe (coincidence?), and due to his bad judgment the ball tipped off the glove and promptly smacked my dad in the face. This instantly broke his nose and sent blood spraying everywhere. My dad, a veteran of broken noses (this was his third), went into the community center and reset it. Then we finished the game. I don’t tell this to describe how tough my dad is, but rather to describe the stubbornness that I was taught to show in the face of pain and danger. Should my dad have gone to the hospital, probably, did he? No, not immediately. He did go later, and had to have surgery to add cartilage back into his perennially broken nose. However, the idea is that things shouldn’t stop because some serious injury has been sustained. 

Back to the story at hand – Now, this is not to say I was in life threatening danger. But my back was a bit bruised. However, did this stop us from hiding and playing the game. No, it did not. We finished the game, and I finished the day teaching. Did I sleep on my side that night, you bet! (BTW my back turned out to have only scratches, and my shirt got really dirty, but whatever, I stayed hidden)

After school, I was to stay with one of the teachers (the second one I had met) in his room at the valley bottom. So we hoofed it back down to his room. He then informed me that since we had to travel back to Huaraz Thursday, we needed to go to Pariacoto to get me a ticket. As we began the walk back to Pariacoto, I could only help but think about how I could have bought a return ticket the day before. However, as I have learned in life, nothing is easy (nada es facil). While in route to Pariacoto it began to rain. So now we were walking in the rain (luckily it was a light rain). After about an hour of walking we go to town, got my ticket, and then the teacher told me that his wife was coming back to town that day. He wanted to wait for her. It was about 430pm at this point. We meandered over to the medical clinic and sat in their doorstop, until 7pm. A little under 3 hours of waiting. Eventually his wife did show up, and decided that, especially since his 4 year old daughter had come with us, that we would take a moto-taxi back. 

Around 8pm we were finally back to Racrao. Since the teacher lives in one room, with his wife (when she’s home and not working), and his daughter, things were a bit small. They wanted to give me their bed, but I vehemently protested and we hauled in a mattress from another room and I slept on the floor. There was no way I would allow the people that were feeding me and letting me into their home to give up their bed. I did not mind the mattress one bit and actually found it quite comfortable, when on my side. It turns out that like all young kids, their daughter only watches two movies (over and over): Barbie the Three Musketeers and The Little Mermaid. So we got to watch both of these before sleep. I can’t believe Disney made Ariel 16 years old, that’s just not right. 

Anyways, after a long day sleep was very welcome. However, before I conclude I have to say that the teacher and his family were extremely welcoming and I am extremely grateful for all they did to make me comfortable. I know they do not have very much, but their hospitality was astonishing and I am extremely grateful. I owe them many thanks (which I tried to convey in my measly Spanish), and only hope was successful.
